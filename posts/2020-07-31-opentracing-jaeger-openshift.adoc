With the ever growing adoption of cloud native application development and microservice architecture, the applications being deployed to the cloud are now comprised of from a few to hundreds of microservices. In order to track the inter communication between each individual microservices, distributed tracing has been implemented to help DevOps teams to keep track of requests being relayed from one service to another. Among all the distributed tracing frameworks, Jaeger and Zipkin are the most popular stack loved by the DevOps teams. In the context of Red Hat OpenShift (we will simply refer it to OpenShift from this point on), Jaeger is arguably the more popular choice as it is the distributed tracing component of the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh framework. If you are interested in an all-in-one bundled observability approach including tracing, visualization, security and networking for your microservice on OpenShift, take a look at the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/service_mesh/service_mesh_arch/understanding-ossm.html[Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh] documents. For developers who are interested only in the distributed tracing side of the equation, the following sections will explain in detail on how to deploy and configure Jaeger and the microservice applications properly for tracing.

== Install Jaeger Operator

The best way to deploy Jaeger on OpenShift is using the Jaeger Operator. It's easy to install via the use of Operator Hub. It also helps the user to automate the setup of many security related configurations. We will also choose a backend storage solution to persist the data. For Jaeger, the official supported storage options are either **Cassandra** or **Elasticsearch**. For this article, I'll pick Elasticsearch due to my past familiarity with Elasticsearch before.

Before the installation, let's first create a new project on our OpenShift cluster called *jaegertracing*.
[source, bash]
----
oc new-project jaegertracing
----

Next, we'll first install Elasticsearch Operator and then Jaeger Operator. To install Elasticsearch Operator, navigate to the Operator Hub and search for Elasticsearch. Follow the prompt to install the operator and make sure that it is installed to the jaegertracing project created earlier.

After the installation of Elasticsearch Operator, follow the similar steps on the Operator Hub to install the Jaeger Operator. Similarly, make sure that it is installed to the same **jaegertracing** project.

After the installation of both Elasticsearch Operator and Jaeger Operator, navigate to the Installed Operators page to verify that both of operators have been installed successfully.

== Configure Jaeger Operator

Before creating a Jaeger instance, let's recap on the Jaeger components. Jaeger is comprised of agent, collector and query -- three main components. Additionally, there is also Jaeger client which is part of your application responsible for instrumenting the application and creating tracers and spans. Jaeger client is available in most of the mainstream languages used for microservices including Java, NodeJs, GO, Python and etc. In a typical Jaeger workflow on OpenShift, Jaeger client instruments the application and creates trace spans in the application code; the trace spans get picked up by the Jaeger agent via UDP and forward to the collector using secured gRPC connection. Jaeger collector makes use of third party storage solutions such as Cassandra and Elasticsearch for data persistence. And finally, user can then query and visualize trace spans stored in the datastore using the Jaeger query service. The overall architecture is illustrated in the diagram below.

[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/blog_jaeger_architecture.png[Figure 3: Typical production grade Jaeger architecture, align="center"]

Next, we need to figure out which deployment strategy to use. A deployment strategy dictates how the Jaeger components should be deployed on OpenShift. The Jaeger CR from Jaeger Operator offers three types of deployment strategy:

1. allInOne
2. Production
3. Streaming

As tempting as one might want to use the default allInOne strategy, its extremely limited capability makes it not suitable for even some serious test/development settings. As the name suggests, allInOne strategy packs the agent, collector and query in a single pod. It's an easy way to start and manage all Jaeger components for some POC works. However there are two limitations that severely handicap the potential of this setup. For one, the allInOne strategy is using memory as its backend storage, so there is no real data persistence as killing the pod will wipe out all the previously collected trace spans. And secondly, allInOne does not allow any scaling as the replica count is locked to 1.

Production strategy in contrast deploys the collector and query processes individually as separate pods on OpenShift, and can be scaled individually on demand. In addition, it supports secured connection with backend storage services like Cassandra and Elasticsearch, which fits our need perfectly. Streaming strategy is essentially production strategy with added support for streaming platform like Kafka, which proves to be beneficial during high loading scenario where the trace spans can be queued inside the streaming platform and wait for their turn to be written to the datastore. We'll discuss some other benefits of streaming strategy in the later section. For the sake of simplicity, we'll use production strategy in our example. 

Let's proceed to create the jaeger yaml file

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: simple-prod
spec:
  strategy: production
  storage:
    type: elasticsearch
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 1
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 1Gi
        limits:
          memory: 1Gi
----

Note that there is barely any detailed configuration for Elasticsearch in the Jaeger yaml file. The Jaeger Operator is able to detect existing Elasticsearch instanced deployed by the Elasticsearch Operator, and auto-provision the secured communication between Elasticsearch and Jaeger processes.

Create the Jaeger instance using the yaml file above. Upon successful creation of the Jaeger instance, the following pod processes will be running on your cluster.

[source, yaml]
----
[root@fwji1-ocp43-inf ~]# oc get pods
NAME                                                           READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

== Prepare your application for OpenShift

You might wonder why there is no agent pod running after the creation of the Jaeger instance. That's because the agent is supposed to be injected as a sidecar container within the application pod in production (and streaming) strategy. The auto injection of the agent side car can be done through annotating the **Namespace** or **Deployments** with **sidecar.jaegertracing.io/inject: "true"** annotation. For controller types other than **Deployment** (ie. StatefulSet, DeploymentConfig, etc), the jaeger agent sidecar must be explicitly defined in the container spec. An example of a StatefulSet with Jaeger agent sidecar container is available at link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.18/operator/#manually-defining-jaeger-agent-sidecars[here].

Now we need to deploy a sample application to create some trace spans for us to test. This link:https://github.com/yurishkuro/opentracing-tutorial[github repoisotry] has some great tutorials on how to create trace spans using Jaeger and OpenTracing API in different languages. For people who are lazy like myself and don't want to code trace spans at all, good news is that this is indeed possible with modern cloud native application runtimes. Open Liberty is such a runtime that supports OpenTracing and Jaeger natively, that developers can generate traces automatically using annotations instead of hand crafting trace spans from ground up. This link:https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-opentracing.html[Open Liberty guide] explains in detail on how to build a Java microservice with Jaeger tracing implemented using MicroProfile OpenTracing feature. I used the services from the Open Liberty guide and created two deployment YAML files for OpenShift deployment. Below is the system service deployment YAML with automatic agent sidecar injection. The image **frankji/system-image** is a Java application running on Open Liberty with MicroProfile OpenTracing feature enabled. We also defined some environment variables that are used by the Jaeger client in my sample application. Of the environment variables used, **JAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE=1** and **JAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM='const'** are set to make sure that every trace generated by the Jaeger client is sampled by the Jaeger collector. **JAEGER_REPORTER_LOG_SPANS='true'** is to turn on the logging of the Jaeger client in our Java mciroservice, so that we know that a trace has been generated.

        - containerPort: 9443
        resources: {}
      restartPolicy: Always
  test: false
status: {}

Once deployed, the application pod will be created with a Jaeger agent sidecar. You should then be able to see the trace spans generated by the application on the Jaeger query UI.

== Additional Configurations

The above example provided a typical Jaeger setup on OpenShift. However depending on the actual use cases and the requirements, there are many other configurations that are possible with Jaeger Operator. For instance, the Elasticsearch used in this example can be replaced with an external Elasticsearch link. Another important configuration is the collector sampling strategies. In a production microservice environment, it may be too expensive to collect and store every trace span reported from the client. As such, a user can configure the collector to use either a probabilistic based or a rate limiting based sampling strategy to reduce the frequency of trace collection. For more advanced users, the addition of a streaming platform like Apache Kafka with the streaming strategy is definitely a worthwhile investment. Not only it can reduce the load on the backend storage during peak loads with its additional layer of storage, it also provides the opportunity for some real-time analytics on certain parts of the streamed tracing data that could complement the information presented in the Jaeger query web console.

== Summary

Distributed tracing has become an essential in the world of observability for microservices. With Jaeger Operator, averages users can now start doing distributed tracing on OpenShift with minimum manual configuration. Yet it still offers tons of configurables for advanced users to leverage the full potential of Jaeger.
