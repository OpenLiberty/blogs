//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
// Do not remove or edit the variables on the lines beneath the author name.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appriopriate/specific image (For example if present an image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title eg: MicroProfile 3.3 is now available on Open Liberty 20.0.0.4
// Replace shin19991207 with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
// Replace Morgan with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, 
// eg: LauraCowen
//
// For every link starting with "https://openliberty.io" in the post make sure to use

// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

BETA_RELEASE_SUMMARY

// // // // // // // //
// Change the RELEASE_SUMMARY to an introductory paragraph. This sentence is really
// important becuase it is supposed to grab the readers attention.  Make sure to keep the blank lines 
//
// Throughout the doc, replace 22.0.0.10-beta with the version number of Open Liberty, eg: 22.0.0.2-beta
// // // // // // // //

The link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] 22.0.0.10-beta includes the following beta features (along with link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/feature-overview.html[all GA features]):

* <<SUB_TAG_0, XML Binding 4.0>>
* <<SUB_TAG_1, Persistence 3.1>>
* <<SUB_TAG_2, BELL SPI Visibility and BELL Properties>>
* <<SUB_TAG_3, MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0>>

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Change SUB_FEATURE_TITLE to the feature that is included in this release and
// change the SUB_TAG_1/2/3 to the heading tags
//
// However if there's only 1 new feature, delete the previous section and change it to the following sentence:
// "The link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] 22.0.0.10-beta includes SUB_FEATURE_TITLE"

   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs.

This feature adopts OpenTelemetry from CNCF to allow MicroProfile Applications to benefit from OpenTelemetry and enable automatic tracing of Jakarta RESTful Web Services if configured.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

```xml
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpTelemetry-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
```

You can view the telemetry data from your application in Jaeger(https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.37/monitoring/#traces)  and Zipkin (https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html). To export your traces to one of these exporters, configure the exporter with system properties, e.g. `-Dotel.traces.exporter=jaeger` or environment variables, e.g. `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=jaeger`.  You can also configure the exporter endpoints using `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT`.  To specify the name of the service, use `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`.
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

=== Try it now 

To try out these features, just update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE XX, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8.
// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Check if a new non-LTS Java SE version is supported that needs to be added to the list (17, 11, and 8 are LTS and will remain for a while)
