Nowadays, in the cloud era, switching between NoSQL solutions could be an interesting way to save resources and costs, but it could be a nightmare, specially if we're highly coupled to a particular vendor. It can cause changes that could make this approach very expensive, e.g.: time spent on the change, the learning curve of a new API to use with this database, the code that will be lost, the persistence layer that needs to be replaced, etc.

This is where the flexibility of Jakarta NoSQL with an implementation like https://www.jnosql.org[Eclipse JNoSQL] together shines.

NOTE: As of March 2024, Eclipse JNoSQL supports about https://www.jnosql.org/docs/supported_dbs.html[30 NoSQL databases].

== Jakarta NoSQL in Action: Switching NoSQL Databases with Ease

To explore this capability, let's use the link:../../../2024/05/06/jakarta-nosql-in-action-meet-jnopo-game.html[*JNopo* game] introduced in blog 2 of this series.

In our scenario, let's suppose that we need to change the *JNopo*'s Document NoSQL database from *MongoDB*, to another Document NoSQL database (e.g. *Couchbase*) to enable us to save money. The good thing is that because we've already used the Jakarta NoSQL specification to connect to our NoSQL solutions in this application, with just a few small changes we'll be able to achieve this goal easily. Let's take a look at the steps we need to take for this.


=== Configuring Eclipse JNoSQL dependencies for Couchbase

The first step we need to take is to add the Couchbase dependency to our the `pom.xml` file:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jnosql.databases</groupId>
  <artifactId>jnosql-couchbase</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Configuring a Local Couchbase Cluster

To successfully configure our new Couchbase cluster, we'll first need to add the following content to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

[source, yaml]
----
  couchbase-db:
    image: couchbase
    container_name: couchbase-db
    ports:
      - "8091-8097:8091-8097"
      - "9123:9123"
      - "11207:11207"
      - "11210:11210"
      - "11280:11280"
      - "18091-18097:18091-18097"
----

After to apply these changes, initialize the container by executing the following command:

[source, bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

Now, let's configure the Couchbase cluster for this study scenario:

. With the Couchbase container started, go to: http://localhost:8091/ui/index.html
. Select the "Configure New Cluster" option
+
[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/couchbase-01.png[Couchbase 01, align="center" width=80%]
. Defines a name for the cluster name
. Set `root` to "Administrator" username
. Set `123456` as "Password"
+
[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/couchbase-02.png[Couchbase 02, align="center" width=80%]
. Check “I accept the terms and conditions” and click the “Finish With Defaults” button
+
[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/couchbase-03.png[Couchbase 03, align="center" width=80%]
. Go to the "Buckets" section
. Create a `jnopo` Bucket by clicking on the "Add Bucket" option
+
[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/couchbase-04.png[Couchbase 04, align="center" width=80%]
. Click on "Scopes & Collections" and then click on "Add Collection"
. Enter `GameMatch` as the collection name and click the "Save" button to complete your creation
+
[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/couchbase-05.png[Couchbase 05, align="center" width=80%]
. Now, in the "Query" section, run this command https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql/[N1QL] to create the primary index for the `GameMatch` collection:
+
[source, n1ql]
----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX primaryGameMatch ON jnopo._default.GameMatch
----
+
[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/couchbase-06.png[Couchbase 06, align="center" width=80%]

With a Couchbase cluster running, we just need to set up Eclipse JNoSQL to connect to it.

Apply the following changes into the `resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file:

[source, properties]
----
## Couchbase
jnosql.couchbase.host=couchbase://localhost
jnosql.couchbase.user=root
jnosql.couchbase.password=123456
jnosql.document.provider=org.eclipse.jnosql.databases.couchbase.communication.CouchbaseDocumentConfiguration
----

The `jnosql.document.provider` property is required in this context because we have more than one Eclipse JNoSQL Database API for Document NoSQL implementations. Learn more about these configurations about Eclipse JNoSQL Database API for Couchbase at this https://github.com/eclipse/jnosql-databases/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-2[Git repository].

That's all! Let's restart the https://openliberty.io/[Open Liberty] runtime in order to be able to make sure that everything is running smoothly:

* On Linux/Mac machines, perform the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
./mvnw liberty:dev
----

* On Windows machines, perform the following command:
+
[source, powershell]
----
mvnw.cmd liberty:dev
----

After some game matches, here are the evidences:

If you're interesting to take a look on the finished project code version developed during this challenge, clone this https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-jakartaNoSQL-game[Git repository] and navigate to the `database-switching-challenge` directory.

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-jakartaNoSQL-game.git
cd sample-jakartaNoSQL-game
cd database-switching-challenge
