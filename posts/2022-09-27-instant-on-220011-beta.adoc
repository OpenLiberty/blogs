Do you want cloud-native Java applications that can start up in milliseconds, without compromising on throughput, memory, development-production parity, or Java language features? The Open Liberty 22.0.0.11-beta brings you InstantOn, an exciting new feature that provides incredibly fast startup times for Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications. 

In serverless environments, application startup times are important. InstantOn application instances can scale to zero when the application is not in use. Scaling to zero can help reduce the overall cloud costs for deployed applications by reducing the overall number of application instances when there are no ongoing requests. When activity picks up for the application, new instances can start up quickly, without introducing high latency for the user.

To enable InstantOn, Open Liberty uses new features of the link:https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/[OpenJ9] JVM and a Linux technology called Checkpoint and Restore link:https://criu.org/[CRIU] to take a checkpoint of the application process as it starts. This checkpoint is a snapshot of the running application process that can be persisted and then quickly restored to bring the application process back into the state it was in when the checkpoint was taken. This process enables the Liberty instance, along with any configured applications, to be restored multiple times into distinct instances of your application. 

To see just how fast InstantOn startup is, skip to the "<<benchmark, How fast is it?>>" section. For more details on the advantages of this approach, see the link:https://blog.openj9.org/2022/09/26/fast-jvm-startup-with-openj9-criu-support/[Fast JVM startup with OpenJ9 CRIU Support] blog post and this earlier link:/blog/2020/02/12/faster-startup-Java-applications-criu.html[Open Liberty blog post] where we first discussed the potential of CRIU for faster startup of Java applications.

The Open Liberty InstantOn feature makes it easy for you to try it out by providing a new `checkpoint` action, which can be executed against your existing Open Liberty server configurations. With the `checkpoint` action, you specify a phase at which you want the Liberty startup process to stop and save a checkpoint.  When Liberty is launched, it will detect the saved checkpoint process and resume the process from the state that it was saved in during the `checkpoint` action.

== Set up the example application project

Before we get into the details of how the `checkpoint` action works, let's set up a working example. For this example, we will have a look at the link:/guides/getting-started.html[Getting started with Open Liberty] guide. If you want to follow along, start by cloning the link:https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started.git[Git repository] for this guide and use the projects that are provided inside:
[source]
----

git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started.git
cd guide-getting-started
----
We will work within the `finish/` directory for this demonstration. To try out the application, run the following Maven goal to build the application and deploy it to Open Liberty:
[source]
----
cd finish
mvn liberty:run
----
After you see the following message, your application server is ready:
[source]
----
The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet.
----
Check out the service at the http://localhost:9080/dev/system/properties URL.

After you finish checking out the application, stop the Open Liberty server by pressing CTRL+C in the command-line session where you ran the server.

To build the WAR for the application run the following :
[source]
----
mvn package
----
This command builds a `target/guide-getting-started.war` archive. We can now include this WAR in a container image that uses the InstantOn feature.

== Containerizing the application
For an application to use Open Liberty InstantOn support, it must first be containerized. For more details on how to containerize your application with Open Liberty, see the link:/guides/containerize.html[Containerizing microservices] guide or the link:/guides/containerize-podman.html[Containerizing microservices with Podman] guide. If you are unfamiliar with Podman, follow the Podman guide first because the Open Liberty InstantOn support currently requires the use of Podman. Support for Docker should come later, once Docker supports the capabilities that CRIU requires.

=== Using the Open Liberty Beta InstantOn Image
The Liberty InstantOn beta image contains the prerequisites for building an application container image with a checkpoint server process.  Applications can use the Liberty InstantOn beta image as a base to build their own application container images and from that create their own application container image with a checkpoint process. This involves the following steps:

1. <<dockerfile, Create the Dockerfile for the application>>
2. <<app-image, Build the application container image>>
3. <<checkpoint-app, Checkpoint an application in-container>>
4. <<checkpoint-image, Create the application checkpoint image>>

==== Prerequisites to checkpoint and restore a containerized application

To build and run container images that use `criu`, the host Operating System needs a few prerequisites installed. All our testing was done on RHEL 8.6 and RHEL 9.0. Other Linux distributions and versions might be possible if they have the necessary prerequisites. The following conditions are required:

* The kernel must support the Linux link:https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html[CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE] capability. This capability was introduced in kernel version 5.9, but was backported to RHEL kernel versions used in RHEL 8.6.
* The latest available version of Podman for the Linux distribution must be installed.
* Podman must be configured to use the `crun` or `runc` container runtime.
* If you use the `runc` container runtime, then version 1.1.3 or higher is required so that you have the recent link:https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3451[fix] to `runc`. This fix enables the successful mount of `/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid` in the container.

[#dockerfile]
=== Create the Dockerfile for the application

For the link:/guides/getting-started.html[Getting started with Open Liberty] example, the first step is to create a `Dockerfile` that provides the instructions to create a containerized version of the application. Note that `podman` also supports using the `Containerfile` format for building container images.

For this example, we will use an official image from the IBM Container Registry (ICR), `icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:beta-instanton-java17-openj9-ubi`, as the parent image. This image is tagged with the word `beta`, meaning it includes all the Liberty beta features as well as all the Liberty features from the `full` image. The image is tagged with `instanton`, meaning it includes all the prerequisites for producing a checkpoint process image, such as the necessary `criu` binary files.

The `Dockerfile` for the getting-started application already exists at `finish/Dockerfile`. Edit the existing `finish/Dockerfile` and change the `FROM` instruction to use the `icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty:beta-instanton-java17-openj9-ubi` parent image. After you save the `Dockerfile`, it should look something like this:

.Dockerfile

[#app-image]
=== Building the application container image
For `criu` to be able to take a checkpoint of and restore a process, the `criu` binary must be granted additional link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/container_security_guide/linux_capabilities_and_seccomp[Linux capabilities]. In particular, for Open Liberty, it needs to be granted `cap_checkpoint_restore`, `cap_net_admin` and `cap_sys_ptrace`. The Open Liberty InstantOn beta image includes the `criu` binary with the necessary capabilities already granted to the `criu` binary file. For the `criu` binary to be given access to its assigned capabilities at run time, the container that is running `criu` must also be granted the necessary capabilities when it is launched. You can grant these capabilities to the container in one of two ways:

. Use a privileged container using the `--privileged` option
. Assign specific capabilities using `--cap-add` options

When using a Docker daemon, the daemon typically has root authority.  This allow it to grant any requested capabilities to a container when it is launching the container. For Podman, there is no daemon running. This means the user launching the container has to have the authority to grant the necessary Linux capabilities to the running container. This can be done by running as root or by using `sudo` to run the `podman` commands. For the purposes of this example it will be assumed you are running the `podman` commands as the root user.

With that understanding, we can now build the container image using the `podman build` command. From the `finish/` directory run the following command to build the container image for the application:
[source]
.Build the application container image
----
podman build -t getting-started .
----

This created the `getting-started` container image.  This container image will not contain any checkpoint image files that can be used for InstantOn startup. You can run this application container image with the following command:
[source]
.Run the application container
----
podman run --name getting-started --rm -p 9080:9080 getting-started
----

Note the amount of time it took for Liberty to report it has been started and check out the service running in the container at the http://localhost:9080/dev/system/properties URL. After you are finished checking out the application, stop the running container by pressing CTRL+C in the command-line session where executed the `podman run` command.

[#checkpoint-app]
=== Checkpoint an application in-container

Open Liberty has three defined places (phases) during the startup process where a checkpoint can occur:

1. `features` - This is the earliest phase during startup where a checkpoint can happen.  The checkpoint will occur after all of the configured Open Liberty features have been started.  This is before any processing occurs for the installed applications.
2. `deployment` - The checkpoint will happen after processing the configured applications meta-data.  If the application has any components that get run as part of the application starting then the checkpoint will be taken before executing any code from the application.
3. `applications` - This is the last phase where a checkpoint can happen, implying that this phase has the potential for providing the fastest startup time when restoring the application instance.  The checkpoint will happen after all configured applications have been reported as started.  This phase happens before opening any ports for listening to incoming requests for the applications.

The `applications` phase typically provides the quickest startup time for an application, but it also may cause some application code to run before the server process checkpoint happens.  This may lead to undesired behavior when restoring the checkpoint process if the application holds on to some state that should not be restored into more than one concurrent instance of the application.  For example, connecting to an outside resource such as a database before the checkpoint is taken will result in a failure to restore many instances of such a process since this would try to restore the same connection multiple times. If your application initialization does not perform such operations, e.g. 
open database connections, it may be possible to use the applications checkpoint in that case.

Once an application container image has been built it can be used to checkpoint the application process at one of the specified checkpoint phases described above (`features`, `deployment`, `applications`). This is done by using the `--env` option to `podman run` to set the value for `WLP_CHECKPOINT` to one of the available checkpoint phases. For this example, use the `applications` phase by running the following `podman` command:

.Perform a checkpoint in container
[source]
----
podman run \
  --name getting-started-checkpoint-container \
  --privileged \
  --env WLP_CHECKPOINT=applications \
  getting-started
----
- The `--privileged` option is required to perform the `criu` checkpoint in-container.
- The `WLP_CHECKPOINT` environment variable is used to specify the checkpoint phase. For the getting-started example the `applications` checkpoint phase will provide the fastest restore time.

This will start the container with the application running with Open Liberty.  Once Open Liberty starts it will perform the checkpoint at the phase specified by the `WLP_CHECKPOINT` environment variable. After the container process data has been persisted the container will stop, leaving you with a stopped container that contains the checkpoint process data. The output will look something like this:

.Process checkpoint output
[source]
----
Performing checkpoint --at=applications

----

This process currently cannot be done as part of a `podman build` step because Podman (and Docker) do not provide a way to grant the container image build the necessary Linux capabilities for `criu` to perform the process checkpoint.

[#checkpoint-image]
=== Create the application checkpoint image

So far we have created the checkpoint process data for the getting-started application and stored it in a stopped container named `getting-started-checkpoint-container`. The final step is to create a new container image containing the checkpoint process data. When this container image is started it will resume the application process right from the point the checkpoint was created resulting in an Instant On application. This is done by running the following `podman commit` operation:

.Commit the checkpoint to an image
[source]
----
podman commit getting-started-checkpoint-container getting-started-instanton
----

Now we have two application images named `getting-started` and `getting-started-instanton`. Starting a container with the `getting-started-instanton` container image will show a much faster startup time than the original `getting-started` image.

== Running the instanton application image
Typically an application container can be started from an application container image with a command like the following:
[source]
----
podman run --rm -p 9080:9080 getting-started-instanton
----
This will fail because `criu` needs some elevated privileges in order to be able to restore the process in-container. When Liberty fails to restore checkpoint process it will recover by launching without the checkpoint image and log the following message:

[source]
----
CWWKE0957I: Restoring the checkpoint server process failed. Check the /logs/checkpoint/restore.log log to determine why the checkpoint process was not restored. Launching the server without using the checkpoint image.
----

=== Running with `--privileged` option

To grant all the required privileges available you can choose to launch a privileged container with the following command:

[source]
----
podman run --rm --privileged -p 9080:9080 getting-started-instanton
----

If successful, you will see output like the following:

[source]
----
[AUDIT   ] CWWKZ0001I: Application guide-getting-started started in 0.059 seconds.
[AUDIT   ] CWWKC0452I: The Liberty server process resumed operation from a checkpoint in 0.088 seconds.

[AUDIT   ] CWWKF0011I: The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet. The defaultServer server started in 0.098 seconds.
----

=== Running with an unprivileged container

Running fully privileged containers is not recommended.  Best practice would be to reduce the elevated privileges down to only what is required to run the container. The following command can be used to grant the container the necessary privileges without running a fully `--privileged` container:

.podman run with unconfined --security-opt options
[source]
----
podman run \
  --rm \
  --cap-add=CHECKPOINT_RESTORE \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  --security-opt systempaths=unconfined \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  -p 9080:9080 \
  getting-started-instanton
----
The `--cap-add` options grant the container the three Linux capabilities that `criu` requires. The `--security-opt` options are necessary to grant `criu` access to the required system calls and access to `/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid` from the host.

=== Running with an unprivileged container with confined security

Additional work can be done to reduce the need for the `--security-opt` options that use `unconfined`. By default `podman` does not grant access to all the system calls that `criu` needs (defaults specified in the file `/usr/share/containers/seccomp.json`).  First, an additional configuration file is needed which grants all the required system calls that `criu` needs to the container. Second, the host `/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid` needs to be mounted. This can be done with the following command:

.podman run with limited --security-opt
[source]
----
podman run \
  --rm \
  --cap-add=CHECKPOINT_RESTORE \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt seccomp=criuRequiredSysCalls.json \
  -v /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid:/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid \
  -p 9080:9080 \
  getting-started-instanton
----
The `--security-opt seccomp=` option refers to a file called <<sys-calls-json,`criuRequiredSysCalls.json`>>. This file specifies the system calls required by `criu`.
The `-v` option mounts the host `/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid` for access by the container.

Depending on your Linux distribution, Podman may use `runc` or `crun` by default. To check what container runtime is configured for your Podman installation run the command `podman info` and have a look at the `ociRuntime` section. If `runc` is used then make sure version 1.1.3 or higher is being used. For this method to work you must have a version of `runc` that is 1.1.3 or greater.

Depending on how up to date your RHEL 8.6 or RHEL 9.0 installation is, you may find that the `--security-opt` for specifying the `criuRequiredSysCalls.json` is unnecessary. At the time of writing, the latest up to date versions of RHEL 8.6 and RHEL 9.0 include a Podman that grants the required system calls to the containers it launches by default. This makes specifying the `--security-opt seccomp=criuRequiredSysCalls.json` unnecessary.

[#benchmark]
== How fast is it?
We have tested multiple applications to show how startup time is reduced with InstantOn. link:https://github.com/HotswapProjects/pingperf-quarkus/[Pingperf] is a very simple ping-type application involve a single REST endpoint. link:https://github.com/johnaohara/quarkusRestCrudDemo/[Rest crud] is a bit more complicated, involving JPA and a remote database. link:https://github.com/blueperf/acmeair-mainservice-java#acme-air-main-service---javaliberty/[AcmeAir Microservice Main] makes use of the microprofile features. These experiments were run on a 24 core system. I used taskset -c to allocate 4 CPUs to the Liberty process running in container. The InstantOn times were taken using the `applications` checkpoint phase. Startup time is measured from the time the Liberty server startup is initiated to the time the server is ready to accept requests, as denoted by the message "The <server name> server is ready to run a smarter planet." in the messages.log. The time it takes to start the container itself up has been filtered out. InstantOn versus normal startup times for these applications are shown here in relative terms, with the baseline times normalized to 100 for each application. Lower is better:

image::img/blog/instantonperf.png[Startup Performance,width=70%,align="center"]

InstantOn offers a large startup savings of up to 90% depending on the application. All applications are not the same, so you may see different results.

== What is next?
This post described the details of using Open Liberty InstantOn beta to produce an application container image with InstantOn startup times. This support currently only allows for Open Liberty features that are included as part of Liberty features webProfile-8.0, webProfile-9.1, microProfile-4.1 and microProfile-5.0. We hope to expand that to include future versions of webProfile and microProfile as well as expand support to the Jakarta full profile features (e.g. jakarta-8.0, jakarta-9.1, jakarta-10.0).

With InstantOn, you can build very fast startup application containers that can be deployed with scale to zero as an option. We look forward to a future blog post that describes how to deploy Open Liberty InstantOn in cloud environments such as Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) and Kubernetes (k8s) with technologies, such as Knative, that can auto-scale applications to zero.
