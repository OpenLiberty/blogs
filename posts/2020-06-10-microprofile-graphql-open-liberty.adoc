Open Liberty 20.0.0.6 introduces a new feature, MicroProfile GraphQL, which enables developers to quick and easily write GraphQL applications with MicroProfile.

If you're here reading about GraphQL in Open Liberty, then chances are that you already know a bit about GraphQL. In short, GraphQL is a remote data access API that addresses
issues like under-fetching and over-fetching that are inherent in most RESTful applications. It allows clients to
specify the exact data they want - to "have it their way". If
you would like to learn more about GraphQL, I recommend checking out the 
link:https://graphql.org/learn/[tutorial at GraphQL.org].

GraphQL applications use a schema that acts as a description of the data provided by the server and as a contract
between the client and server. Most GraphQL programming models require developers to dual-maintain their schema and the
application code that supports it. MicroProfile GraphQL takes a "code first" approach which allows developers to write
Java code using annotations to mark GraphQL schema elements, and then the MicroProfile GraphQL implementation generates the schema
at runtime.

The Open Liberty feature Microprofile GraphQL (`mpGraphQL-1.0`) implements the 
link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-graphql/releases/tag/1.0.2[MicroProfile GraphQL 1.0] specification. 

In this blog post, we'll explore how easy it is to create GraphQL applications using this 
link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-mp-graphql[sample].

// tag::setup[]
== Setup

To set up your Maven environment for developing a MP GraphQL application, you'll need a dependency like:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.graphql</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile-graphql-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

I recommend using the link:/guides/maven-intro.html[Liberty Maven plugin], but it's not strictly
necessary so long as you generate a Web Archive (WAR) file for deployment.

When configuring the Liberty server for deployment, make sure that the `featureManager` element in the `server.xml` file
contains the `mpGraphQL-1.0` feature. For example:

[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>mpGraphQL-1.0</feature>
    <feature>mpMetrics-2.3</feature>
  </featureManager>
  <!-- ... -->
</server>
----

The `mpMetrics-2.3` feature is not required, but will track the number of GraphQL query/mutation invocations and
cumulative time when enabled.

Now that we've got things set up, let's look at the code.
// end::setup[]

// tag::coding[]
== Coding a MicroProfile GraphQL application

A MicroProfile GraphQL application should have at least one root-level query and/or mutation. To create a query or
mutation, you start with a public Java class annotated with `@GraphQLApi`. Then you add public methods that are
annotated with `@Query` or `@Mutation` for query or mutation, respectively. The query/mutation methods must always
return a non-void type. These methods can return simple types like `String`, `int`, `double`, `boolean`, etc. which will
be mapped to GraphQL scalars such as `String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`, etc. Alternatively, these methods could return
custom Java types - the types would be mapped to GraphQL types and defined in the generated schema.

For example, in the
sample application, the `currentConditions` query method returns a type called `Conditions` - that type has properties
such as `temperatureF`, `temperatureC`, `precipitationType`, `weatherText`, etc. The following schema is generated
from the query and its return value:

[source]
----
type Conditions {
  dayTime: Boolean!
  epochTime: BigInteger!
  hasPrecipitation: Boolean!
  "ISO-8601"
  localObservationDateTime: DateTime
  location: String
  precipitationType: PrecipType
  temperatureC: Float!
  temperatureF: Float!
  weatherText: String
  wetBulbTempF: Float!
}

"Query root"
type Query {
  currentConditions(location: String): Conditions
  currentConditionsList(locations: [String]): [Conditions]
}
...
----

The `currentConditions` query has an argument, called `location`. In the Java code, the argument is represented by a
method parameter. Like output types, arguments/parameters can be simple Java types (mapping to GraphQL scalars) or
custom types, which would be mapped to input types in the generated schema.

When mapping custom types, it is possible to change the name used in the schema by using the `@Name`
annotation. For example, if we wanted to change the schema to display `tempInFahrenheit` instead of `temperatureF`, we
could just add `@Name("tempInFahrenheit")` to the `temperatureF` field in the `Conditions` class.

If your application uses JSON-B, then `@JsonbProperty`, `@JsonbDateFormat`, and `@JsonbNumberFormat` annotations can be
used instead of `@Name`, `@DateFormat` or `@NumberFormat`. When both sets of annotations are used, the annotations from
the MicroProfile GraphQL APIs take precedence over the JSON-B APIs when used for schema generation or query/mutation execution.

Another useful annotation is `@Source`. This annotation can be used to add a field to an entity object that might be
expensive to look up or calculate, and so you might not want to spend the resources on the server side to compute that
field when the client doesn't want it anyway.  Here's an example from the sample:

[source,java]
----
    public double wetBulbTempF(@Source @Name("conditions") Conditions conditions) {
        // TODO: pretend like this is a really expensive operation
        // ...
        return conditions.getTemperatureF() - 3.0;
    }
----

This example is a little contrived, but it shows us that the `wetBulbTempF` field will only be computed if the client
requests that field. This method is in a class annotated with `@GraphQLApi` (in this example, `WeatherService`) and it
contains a parameter annotated with `@Source` that takes the entity object, `Conditions`. When a client issues a query
or mutation that would return the `Conditions` entity, and that query/mutation specifies the `wetBulbTempF` field, the `wetBulbTempF(Conditions conditions)` method is invoked by the GraphQL implementation, passing in the
`Conditions` object that was returned from the query/mutation method.

== Running the MicroProfile GraphQL app

To run and test the GraphQL application, you simply need to deploy it as a WAR file. The Liberty Maven
Plugin makes it easy to build, deploy, and test using Apache Maven. After you have cloned the sample from GitHub
(`git clone git@github.com:OpenLiberty/sample-mp-graphql.git`) or downloaded the source ZIP file, just run:
`mvn clean package liberty:run`

This builds, packages, and deploys the GraphQL application to the latest Open Liberty server runtime and starts the 
server and app. Then you can use the pre-packaged GraphiQL HTML interface to send queries or mutations at:
`http://localhost:9080/mpGraphQLSample/graphiql.html`

Here are a few sample queries and mutations that you could use to get started - you may see some interesting results:

[source,graphql]
----
#Temperature (Fahrenheit) for Las Vegas
query LasVegas {
  currentConditions(location: "Las Vegas") {
    temperatureF
  }
}
----

[source,graphql]
----
#Is it really always sunny in Philadelphia?
query SunnyInPhilly {
  currentConditions(location: "Philadelphia") {
    weatherText
  }
}
----

[source,graphql]
----
# Weather conditions for three locations - one roundtrip
query threeLocations {
  atlanta: currentConditions(location: "Atlanta") {
        hasPrecipitation
        temperatureF
        weatherText
        precipitationType
    }
  newyork: currentConditions(location: "New York") {
        hasPrecipitation
        temperatureF
        weatherText
        precipitationType
  }
  chicago: currentConditions(location: "Chicago") {
        hasPrecipitation
        temperatureF
        weatherText
        precipitationType
    }
}
----

[source,graphql]
----
# See partial results when one portion of the query fails
query fourLocations {
  atlanta: currentConditions(location: "Atlanta") {
        hasPrecipitation
        temperatureF
        weatherText
        precipitationType
        wetBulbTempF
    }
  nowhere: currentConditions(location: "Nowhere") {
    hasPrecipitation
        temperatureF
        weatherText
        precipitationType
  }
  newyork: currentConditions(location: "New York") {
        hasPrecipitation
        temperatureF
        weatherText
        precipitationType
  }
  chicago: currentConditions(location: "Chicago") {
        hasPrecipitation
        temperatureF
        weatherText
        precipitationType
        wetBulbTempF
    }
}

[source,graphql]

# Reset the stored weather conditions
mutation {
  reset
}

// end:: running[]

// tag::authorization[]
== Authorizing access to certain queries/mutations

It may be necessary to restrict access to certain queries/mutations to certain authenticated users. While it is not part
of the MicroProfile GraphQL 1.0 specification (it is under consideration for a future version of the spec), Open Liberty
makes authorization checks possible by using the `@DenyAll`, `@PermitAll`, and `@RolesAllowed` annotations. These
annotations must be placed on the class or method of classes annotated with `@GraphQLApi`.

When implementing authorization with MicroProfile GraphQL, you need to enable the `appSecurity-3.0` (or `appSecurity-2.0`) feature in the
server configuration. You also need to set up the user registry and web container metadata for authentication and
authorization.

In the sample, we use the basic user registry which defines two users, one for each of two roles:

[source,xml]
----
  <basicRegistry id="basic" realm="sample-mp-graphql">
     <user name="user1" password="user1pwd" />
     <user name="user2" password="user2pwd" />
     <group name="Role1">
       <member name="user1"/>
     </group>
     <group name="Role2">
       <member name="user2"/>
     </group>
   </basicRegistry>
----

This means that `user1` is part of `Role1` and `user2` is part of `Role2`. The `web.xml` declares these roles, and also sets up
form-based authentication so that, when the Application Security feature is enabled, clients are prompted to log in using a
web-based form before accessing the GraphiQL HTML page.  It also allows the application to prevent users other than
those in `Role2` to invoke the `reset` mutation method:

[source,java]
----
    @RolesAllowed("Role2")
    @Mutation
    @Description("Reset the cached conditions so that new queries will return newly randomized weather data." +
                 "Returns number of entries cleared.")
    public int reset() {
        int cleared = currentConditionsMap.size();
        currentConditionsMap.clear();
        return cleared;
    }
----


// end::authorization[]

// tag::metrics[]
== Integration with MicroProfile Metrics

If you enable the `mpMetrics-2.3` feature with `mpGraphQL-1.0`, Open Liberty tracks the number of times a particular
query or mutation method is invoked--and the cumulative time spent in that method. These metrics can be useful for
determining what data is being accessed, how often, and where time is spent in execution.

Metrics collection and reporting for GraphQL applications is not mentioned in either the MicroProfile GraphQL 1.0 spec or the
MicroProfile Metrics 2.3 spec, so the actual stats are collected and reported under the "vendor" category. To see these stats,
you can browse to:
`http://localhost:9080/metrics/vendor`

The stats are prefixed with `vendor_mp_graphql_` and should look something like this:

[source]
----
# TYPE vendor_mp_graphql_Query_currentConditions_total counter
vendor_mp_graphql_Query_currentConditions_total 27
# TYPE vendor_mp_graphql_Query_currentConditions_elapsedTime_seconds gauge
vendor_mp_graphql_Query_currentConditions_elapsedTime_seconds 0.10273818800000001
# TYPE vendor_mp_graphql_Conditions_wetBulbTempF_total counter
vendor_mp_graphql_Conditions_wetBulbTempF_total 4
# TYPE vendor_mp_graphql_Conditions_wetBulbTempF_elapsedTime_seconds gauge
vendor_mp_graphql_Conditions_wetBulbTempF_elapsedTime_seconds 0.031866015000000004
# TYPE vendor_mp_graphql_Mutation_reset_total counter
vendor_mp_graphql_Mutation_reset_total 3
# TYPE vendor_mp_graphql_Mutation_reset_elapsedTime_seconds gauge
vendor_mp_graphql_Mutation_reset_elapsedTime_seconds 0.007540145000000001
