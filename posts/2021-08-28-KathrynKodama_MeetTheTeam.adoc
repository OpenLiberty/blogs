In this blog series, we'll be highlighting some of the amazing individuals who contribute to Open Source software. We'll be delving into their contributions within OSS, their career journey, how being involved in OSS has helped them, what they enjoy about contributing to OSS and their advice for getting involved.

== Introduction:
Kathryn is a software developer on the Open Liberty Developer Experience team at IBM Canada. She has contributed to a number of open-source projects within the link:https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile (TM)] and link:https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE (TM)] community, such as the Language Server for MicroProfile, the Jakarta EE Language Server, and the MicroProfile Starter for link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] (VS code). Kathryn has also contributed to the development of dev mode for link:https://openliberty.io/[OpenLiberty], and corresponding editor plugins.

== Tech introduction:
Open Liberty dev mode is a hot deployment tool that is made available as a goal of the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven[Liberty Maven plug-in] or as a task of the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle[Liberty Gradle plug-in]. This enables developers to iterate quickly when developing their cloud-native Java applications with Open Liberty. Once dev mode has started, code changes are picked up and automatically compiled and deployed to the running server. Tests can be run on every code change or on demand and you can connect to a debugger. Dev mode also offers container support, so you can develop your application locally while your Liberty server runs in a container.

The link:https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4mp[MicroProfile Language Server] and link:https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4jakarta[Jakarta EE Language Server] both offer language specific support in an IDE or editor for their respective technologies. The goal of both these projects is to enable developers to quickly develop their cloud-native Java applications using the MicroProfile and Jakarta EE specifications by delivering language support capabilities, such as diagnostics, code completes, and hover for more information, directly within their IDE of choice.

The link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MicroProfile-Community.mp-starter-vscode-ext[MicroProfile Starter for VS Code], link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MicroProfile-Community.vscode-microprofile-pack[VS Code Extension Pack for MicroProfile], and the Open Liberty Tools for link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Open-Liberty.liberty-dev-vscode-ext[VS Code] and link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14856-open-liberty-tools[IntelliJ] projects are all IDE specific plugins that users can download from the VS Code or IntelliJ marketplace.

The MicroProfile Starter for VS Code consumes the MicroProfile Starter (https://start.microprofile.io/) project and allows developers to generate a starter project using the MicroProfile specifications and runtime of their choosing all within the VS Code IDE. The extension pack for MicroProfile bundles MicroProfile specific VS Code extensions, such as the MicroProfile Starter, the MicroProfile REST Client Generator and the Tools for MicroProfile extension (which consumes the above mentioned MicroProfile Language Server project) so that developers can easily download one extension pack and make use of all these technologies. The Open Liberty Tools for VS Code and IntelliJ are currently available as a tech preview and offer additional in-editor support for your Open Liberty projects. Both extensions contribute commands to easily start and stop Open Liberty dev mode, as well as run tests and view test reports.

All of the technologies mentioned are focused on improving the developer experience at every step of the development lifecycle, from project generation using the MicroProfile Starter extension, language-assisted support within an IDE for MicroProfile or Jakarta EE, or hot deploying your application with Open Liberty dev mode.

== Q&A:

[#importance]
=== Why is developer experience important? What is involved in this role? Give a brief description of the day-to-day activities you do in this role
Creating a positive experience for developers will enable them to be more productive and create quality software. A better experience for developers means that more developers will be inclined to continue using our products.

On the Liberty Developer Experience team, there are a number of projects we regularly contribute to. My day-to-day involves adding enhancements to dev mode (recently adding multi-module support for Maven projects), or any of the IDE extensions we support, such as the MicroProfile Starter for VS Code, or Open Liberty Tools for IntelliJ tech preview. Part of this role also involves talking about our tools at conferences and keeping up with the open-source MicroProfile and Jakarta EE community.

[#benefits]
=== What benefits do the plugins you mentioned offer?
IDE plugins, specifically the ones our team works on for MicroProfile and Open Liberty, offers our users an improved experience within their editors. Without leaving their editor, they are able to use tools like the MicroProfile Starter or Open Liberty dev mode without having to reference external documentation or visit an external site. This enables developers to focus on the actual code of their application, as opposed to some of the details around initially creating a project, configuring Open Liberty, and deploying to a server.

[#devex]
=== How can open-source projects create better developer experiences? Could you give an example?
By developing our projects in the open-source, we can receive direct feedback from our users through avenues like GitHub issues or Gitter. Open-source projects also allow us to collaborate with other interested parties in order to build better tools for developers. For example, both our team and developers at Red Hat are actively contributing to link:https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4mp[LSP4MP], the Language Server for MicroProfile. When there is a technology like MicroProfile that is widely used by many developers, it is helpful to be able to leverage the community to build these tools, as they are also the ones that will benefit from using them.

[#contributions]
=== In addition to contributing to code within these open source projects, what other contributions have you made? (i.e. documentation, tutorials, blogs, etc.)
I have contributed to the documentation of the IDE extensions mentioned above (Open Liberty Tools for IntelliJ and VS Code, the VS Code extension pack for MicroProfile, etc.). I have also written blog posts (much like this one) to highlight some new features or releases of our project, such as the link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/09/03/open-liberty-tools-intellij.html[Open Liberty Tools for IntelliJ initial tech preview release]. Beyond these forms of communication, there are a number of presentations and conferences that I have spoken at with the team. These range from a Practical Microservices workshop delivered to university students, to presenting at a Jakarta Tech Talk to showcase the work being done on the Jakarta EE Language Server project.

[#impact]
=== How has your involvement in open-source projects impacted upon your work or impacted you personally?
Being involved in open-source projects has greatly improved my technical skills and introduced me to a whole new community of developers. I have really enjoyed having the opportunity to network and meet many new people in the community, whether through conferences or directly in pull request comments. I have also gained a deeper understanding of technologies like MicroProfile and Jakarta EE which has strengthened my skills as a Java EE developer.

[#internship]
=== How did your internship help you to transition to a full-time role?
My internship gave me the opportunity to ensure that this is the right role for me as I start my career. As an intern I was given ample opportunity to experience the different aspects of my current role, from development to testing, presenting at conferences, meeting my team, and getting involved in volunteer opportunities like IBM STEM for Girls.

Given my positive internship, I was able to confidently transition into my full-time role knowing that I was interested in the technologies we work and that IBM was the best company for me to start my career with. I knew I would have support to pick up new projects, learn new technologies, and pursue volunteer opportunities.

You can read more about my internship experience in the IBM careers blog I authored link:https://www.ibm.com/blogs/jobs/2019/05/31/7-reasons-my-ibm-internship-got-me-off-to-a-great-start/[here].


[#university]
=== As someone who is regularly involved with local universities, how do you see open-source projects viewed by students?
From my perspective, now more than ever students are looking to contribute to open-source projects in order to build their technical skills, portfolios and their networks. The challenge comes in helping students find an open-source project they are interested in and getting over the hurdle of a first pull request. We can help by raising awareness for our projects, through blog posts, YouTube videos, etc. and participating in programs that help introduce students to open-source software development.

Our team has found success in engaging with students through the link:https://canosp.ca/[Canada Open Source Projects (CANOSP)] academic program. This program connects students with open-source projects and mentors in exchange for course credit. With this program we have seen a lot of interest from students when contributing to open-source projects. Open-source software clubs are also becoming more prevalent on University campuses. These are clubs where students get together and find open-source projects to contribute to as a group.

[#advice]
=== What advice would you give to developers that are interested in getting started with an open-source project? 
Seek out programs or clubs that help beginners get started contributing to open-source software, whether that is the Canadian Open Source Projects (CANOSP) academic program or an event like link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/[Hacktoberfest]. Seek out projects that you interest you or perhaps you have used in some of your other work. You can also filter by the "good first issue" tag on GitHub to find issues that need to be picked up that have been specifically tagged as good introductory issues on open-source projects. Do not be afraid to open your first PR, maintainers of these projects will be happy to see others contributing!

[#outside]
=== Outside of work, what do you like getting up to?
Lately I have been camping and hiking a lot as that is one of the safer activities to do throughout the pandemic. I have really enjoyed spending more time outside and getting to visit many of the beautiful provincial parks here in Ontario!
