[#oidc]
== Use issuer claim for selecting which configuration to use for a JWT inbound propagation request (OpenID Connect Client 1.0)

Starting in 22.0.0.10, the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/openidConnectClient-1.0.html[OpenID Connect Client 1.0] feature supports using the issuer claim from the JWT or JWS access token for selecting which `openidConnectClient` configuration to use for a JWT inbound propagation request.  Prior to this release, complicated authentication filters were required if more than one issuer was used for the same resource. Instead, the OpenID Connect Client 1.0 feature can now be configured with simpler `openidConnectClient` elements for each required issuer.

A Liberty OpenID Connect Relying Party will automatically use the issuer claim from a JWT or JWS access token to select the `openidConnectClient` configuration with a matching `issuer` attribute. 

The following `server.xml` file example shows two Open ID connect client configurations, with an link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/authentication-filters.html[authentication filter] configured to route requests to the `RP2` configuration. If a request with an issuer claim value of `https://hostname/op1` is presented, the `RP1` configuration is selected unless the `rp2filter` applies to the request.
[source, xml]
----
<server>
    <featureManager>
        <feature>openidConnectClient-1.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ...
    <openidConnectClient id="RP1" issuer="https://hostname/op1"  ... />
    <openidConnectClient id="RP2" issuer="https://hostname/op2" authFilterRef="rp2filter" .../>
    <authFilter id="rp2filter">
    ...
    </authFilter>
    ...
</server>
----

Open Liberty selects the `openidConnectClient` configuration to use for a JWT request according to the following algorithm:

1. If the authentication filter for a `openidConnectClient` configuration matches the request, choose that configuration.
2. Check the issuer claim from the JWT against the `issuer` attributes from of all `openidConnectClient` elements. If the issuer claim from the JWT matches the `issuer` attribute in only one `openidConnectClient` configuration element, choose that configuration.
3. If the issuer claim from the JWT matches the `issuer` attribute in multiple `openidConnectClient` configuration elements, choose the first configuration that matches.
4. If the issuer claim from the JWT does not match the `issuer` attribute of any `openidConnectClient` configuration elements, choose one of the configuration elements in a nondeterministic manner.

[#bugs]
== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A220010+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 22.0.0.10].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/20599[JDBC connection not validated when numConnectionsPerThreadLocal is used]
+
When a JDBC datasource is configured with `validationTimeout`, the connection pool should validate a connection before it is passed back to the application. If the connection is invalid (e.g. after a database failover event), other connections in the pool should be purged according to the `purgePolicy` configuration. The application should therefore rarely receive an invalid database connection.
+
However, if the connection manager is configured with `numConnectionsPerThreadLocal=1`, once a connection is stashed as a `ThreadLocal`, it isn't validated before being used by the application, which results in a `SQLException`. Also, if the application calls `isValid` on the connection and the connection is determined to be invalid, the connection manager does not apply the `purgePolicy` logic to other connections in the pool, so clients may see multiple errors until each of the worker threads is used. 
+
```
    <dataSource id="fhirDatasourcePglocalDefault" jndiName="jdbc/fhir_ibmfhirpg_default" type="javax.sql.XADataSource" statementCacheSize="200" syncQueryTimeoutWithTransactionTimeout="true" validationTimeout="30s">
        <jdbcDriver javax.sql.XADataSource="org.postgresql.xa.PGXADataSource" libraryRef="sharedLibPostgres"/>
        <properties.postgresql
             serverName="localhost"
             portNumber="5432"
             databaseName="a-database-name"
             user="a-database-user"
             password="a-database-password"
             currentSchema="a-database-schema"
         />
        <connectionManager
            minPoolSize="40"
            maxPoolSize="80"
            agedTimeout="-1"
            numConnectionsPerThreadLocal="1"
            connectionTimeout="60s"
            maxIdleTime="2m"
            purgePolicy="EntirePool"
        />
    </dataSource>
```
+
After the fix, with `validationTimeout` configured, the connection is validated before use and the connection pool is purged of bad connections according to `purgePolicy`.


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21914[JobOperator.getRunningExecutions output includes job executions that aren't running]
+
A bug caused the Liberty Java batch `JobOperator.getRunningExecutions()` API call returns all job execution IDs associated with a running job instance, instead of just those job executions IDs that are running.
+
After the fix, when `JobOperator.getRunningExecutions()` is called for that job name, both the original (stopped) and the new (restarted) execution IDs are returned.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21805[Removed hideMessage logging attribute not dynamically picked up during server configuration update]
+
Removal of message ID prefixes from the `hideMessage` logging attribute was not honored on a running server.
+ 
This issue is now resolved and the configuration of the running server is properly updated to no longer hide the messages that were removed from the attribute.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22189[Missing NLS strings for allowAuthenticationFailOverToAuthMethod options]
+
The `AllowAuthenticationFailOverToAuthMethod` option descriptions all had untranslated NLS constants.  This was due to the constants missing from the NLS file for the metatype.
+
With the fix, all the `AllowAuthenticationFailOverToAuthMethod` option descriptions are now properly translated.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22221[Session timing issue during server shutdown]
+
Due to a session cache service timing issue during server shutdown, it was possible that the invalidation thread hits in the middle of cacheservice teardown.  This could occur due to the cache instance not being checked when processing invalid listeners.
+
The issue has been resolved in this release.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22347[FFDCIgnore not honored on or after 22.0.0.4]
+
Starting in 22.0.0.4, when a resource adapter with a 1.0 spec deployment descriptor was installed, the `@FFDCIgnore` annotation was ignored causing an FFDC to be incorrectly emitted.
+
After the fix, the FFDC is no longer created.
