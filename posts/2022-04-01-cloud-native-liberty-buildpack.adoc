//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appriopriate/specific image (for example if present an image that is being used in the post). 
// However, it can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title
//
// Replace SECOND_AUTHOR_NAME with the name of the second author.
// Replace SECOND_GITHUB_USERNAME with the GitHub user name of the second author.
// Replace THIRD_AUTHOR_NAME with the name of the third author. And so on for fourth, fifth, etc authors.
// Replace THIRD_GITHUB_USERNAME with the GitHub user name of the third author. And so on for fourth, fifth, etc authors.
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as first author.
// Replace GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-02-12-faster-startup-Java-applications-criu.adoc
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around
// screenshots but not around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark backgrounds.
// Once again make sure to double check how it looks
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

== What is a buildpack?

A buildpack is a set of executables that inspects your app source code and creates a plan to build and run your application.  

Paketo buildpacks are toolkits and workflows for building reproducible container images from source code.

The link:https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/liberty[Paketo Cloud Native Liberty buildpack] provides the Open Liberty runtime to a workflow that produces an Open Container Initiative (OCI) image that can run just about anywhere.

== What do you need?
* Your application source

* link:https://hub.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community[Docker]

* The link:https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/[pack CLI]

== Let's get started!

Download the Open Liberty starter app:
[source]
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started.git
cd guide-getting-started/start

Set a default builder:
[source]
pack config default-builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base

Build the app:
[source]
pack build myapp --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty

Your application now is ready to run. 

[source]

== Build your app from an on-prem Open Liberty installation
You can build from an on-prem Open Liberty installation by using a packaged Liberty server. Run the following command to package your server.
[source]
bin/server package defaultServer --include=usr

You can then supply the packaged server to the build by using the `--path` argument:
[source]
pack build --path <packaged-server-zip-path> --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty myapp 

Or to build from a Liberty server installation, change your working directory to the installation root containing the wlp directory and run:
[source]
pack build --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty myapp
