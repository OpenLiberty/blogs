   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?  
    
Liberty provides convenience features for running all of the component specifications that are contained in the Jakarta EE Web Profile and Jakarta EE Platform.  `webProfile-10.0` and `jakartaee-10.0` Liberty features provide the Jakarta EE Web Profile and Jakarta EE Platform version 10 Liberty features respectively.  To use Jakarta EE 10 features in the application client, the `jakartaeeClient-10.0` Liberty feature is used.

Using these convenience features enables developers to rapidly develop applications using all of the APIs contained in the Web Profile and Platform specifications.  Unlike the `webProfile-9.1`Liberty feature, the `webProfile-10` Liberty feature does not enable the XML Binding feature since XML Binding is not a Web Profile component specification.  If your application relies on XML Binding APIs, you will need to explicitly enable the `xmlBinding-4.0` Liberty feature when using the `webProfile-10.0` Liberty feature.

To enable the Jakarta EE 10 beta features in your application’s `server.xml`:
```
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jakartaee-10.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
```
Or you can add the Web Profile convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 10 Web Profile beta features at once:
```
  <featureManager>
    <feature>webProfile-10.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
```
To run Jakarta EE 10 features on the Application Client Container in your application's `client.xml`:
```
 <featureManager>
       <feature>jakartaeeClient-10.0</feature>
 </featureManager>
```
For more information see the [Jakarta EE Platform 10 Specification](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/) and the [Jakarta EE Web Profile 10 Specification](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/webprofile/10/).

3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

> Application Security 5.0 enables support for securing the server runtime environment and applications using Jakarta Security 3.0. The Jakarta Security 3.0 specification allows using built-in authentication mechanisms and identity stores as well as providing your own custom implementations for authenticating users to protected resources. The specification introduces a new built-in authentication mechanism based on the Authorization Code Flow of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

> Jakarta Security 3.0 allows using the new `@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation to configure a built-in OpenID Connect authentication mechanism to function as an OpenID Connect client, or Relying Party (RP), so that you can use an OpenID Connect Provider (OP) as a single-sign-on identity provider. It also introduces the `OpenIdContext` bean and various APIs for handling the access token, identity token, and refresh token.
   
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

> You can enable the Application Security 5.0 (Jakarta Security 3.0) feature by using the appSecurity-5.0 feature in the server.xml file,

>
> You can use the `@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation in a Web or JAX-RS application to enable an OpenID Connect client for that application. The following example shows a servlet with a minimal `@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation when the OP is a Liberty OP:

3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
-    **Open Liberty provides First Failure Data Capture(FFDC) capability and the number of files in the FFDC directory can grow to a very large amount. Currently, Open Liberty will automatically purge FFDC files in excess of 500 but this value is not configurable. A new feature is added to match the Websphere Application Server functionality which automatically purges FFDC log files after reaching a configured age. This is done through a new configuration attribute, `maxFfdcAge`.** 

- **`maxFfdcAge` is the maximum desired age before an FFDC file is deleted. At midnight everyday, any FFDC file that has reached the maximum configured age will be deleted. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be days (d), hours (h), or minutes (m). For example, specify 2 days as 2d. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 2d6h is equivalent to 2 days and 6 hours.**

```
<server>

3. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
     > Jakarta Faces is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for building web applications. It offers many convenient features, such as state management and input validation.
     
   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
     >  Numerous changes have occurred since the last Jakarta Faces release. Notably, Pages (formerly JSP) support has been removed. Managed Beans support has also been removed, and developers should use CDI beans from this version forward. The namespaces also have been updated from `http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/*`  to `jakarta.faces.*`. Otherwise, new attributes have been added to existing tags: multiple and accept for h:inputFile and onerror for f:websocket. Developers may now create facelets programmatically rather than building them via XML. Extensionless mapping has been implemented, so URLs no longer need to include /faces or .xhtml mappings. Two new tags have been added: f:selectItemGroups and f:selectItemGroup to create a nested collections (i.e., optgroup containing option elements).  These are just some significant changes, but there have been many more.
     > The faces-4.0 feature uses MyFaces, but if a developer wishes to use an alternative Faces implementation, such as Mojarra 4.0, that can be accomplished via facesContainer-4.0. The Faces API and implementation jars just need to be included in the application WEB-INF/lib folder.
