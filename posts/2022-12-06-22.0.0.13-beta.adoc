[#jakarta10]
== Jakarta EE 10 Platform and Web Profile

In the Open Liberty 22.0.0.9-beta, we made available Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile and ever since we've been hard at work releasing more Jakarta EE 10 features with each subsequent beta.  We're proud to announce that the 22.0.0.13-beta is the culmination of that effort and makes available Jakarta EE 10.0 Application Client, Jakarta EE Web Profile 10.0, and Jakarta EE Platform 10.0.

Liberty provides convenience features for running all of the component specifications that are contained in the Jakarta EE Web Profile and Jakarta EE Platform.  `webProfile-10.0` and `jakartaee-10.0` Liberty features provide the Jakarta EE Web Profile and Jakarta EE Platform version 10 Liberty features respectively.  To use Jakarta EE 10 features in the application client, the `jakartaeeClient-10.0` Liberty feature is used.

Using these convenience features enables developers to rapidly develop applications using all of the APIs contained in the Web Profile and Platform specifications.  Unlike the `webProfile-9.1`Liberty feature, the `webProfile-10` Liberty feature does not enable the XML Binding feature since XML Binding is not a Web Profile component specification.  If your application relies on XML Binding APIs, you will need to explicitly enable the `xmlBinding-4.0` Liberty feature when using the `webProfile-10.0` Liberty feature.

To enable the Jakarta EE 10 beta features in your application’s `server.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jakartaee-10.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----
Or you can add the Web Profile convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 10 Web Profile beta features at once:
[source,xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>webProfile-10.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----
To run Jakarta EE 10 features on the Application Client Container in your application's `client.xml`:
[source,xml]
----
 <featureManager>
       <feature>jakartaeeClient-10.0</feature>
 </featureManager>
----
For more information see the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/10/[Jakarta EE Platform 10 Specification] and the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/webprofile/10/[Jakarta EE Web Profile 10 Specification].

[#authentication]
== Application Authentication 3.0 (Jakarta Authentication 3.0)
Jakarta Authentication defines a general low-level SPI for authentication mechanisms, which are controllers that interact with a caller and a container's environment to obtain the caller's credentials, validate these, and pass an authenticated identity (such as name and groups) to the container.


Multiple enhancements are made available in Jakarta Authentication 3.0, including providing methods to add and remove single server auth module, and the addition of default methods to `ServerAuth` and `ClientAuth` modules.

You can enable the Jakarta Authentication 3.0 feature by enabling the `appAuthentication-3.0` feature in the server.xml file:
   
[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>appAuthentication-3.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
----

For more information see the https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/authentication/3.0/_index.md[Jakarta Authentication 3.0] specification.

[#authorization]
== Application Authorization 2.1 (Jakarta Authorization 2.1)
Jakarta Authorization defines a low-level SPI for authorization modules, which are repositories of permissions facilitating subject based security by determining whether a given subject has a given permission, and algorithms to transform security constraints for specific containers (such as Jakarta Servlet or Jakarta Enterprise Beans) into these permissions.

Jakarta Authorization 2.1 specification provides enhancements to the Jakarta Authorization 2.0 specification by the addition of new methods to read permissions.  One such addition is the ability to get the `PolicyConfiguration`, which is used for authorization.  Prior to Jakarta Authorization 2.1, the spec did not have the flexibility to read permissions from the `PolicyConfiguration` and required complex wrapper code to get the `PolicyConfiguration`.
   
You can enable the Jakarta Authorization 2.1 feature by using the `appAuthorization-2.1` feature in the server.xml file:
   
[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>appAuthorization-2.1</feature>
    </featureManager>
----
   
For more information see the https://github.com/jakartaee/specifications/blob/master/authorization/2.1/_index.md[Jakarta Authorization 2.1] specification.

[#security]
== Application Security 5.0 (Jakarta Security 3.0)

Application Security 5.0 enables support for securing the server runtime environment and applications using Jakarta Security 3.0. The Jakarta Security 3.0 specification allows using built-in authentication mechanisms and identity stores as well as providing your own custom implementations for authenticating users to protected resources. The specification introduces a new built-in authentication mechanism based on the Authorization Code Flow of the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification.

Jakarta Security 3.0 allows using the new `@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation to configure a built-in OpenID Connect authentication mechanism to function as an OpenID Connect client, or Relying Party (RP), so that you can use an OpenID Connect Provider (OP) as a single-sign-on identity provider. It also introduces the `OpenIdContext` bean and various APIs for handling the access token, identity token, and refresh token.
   
You can use the `@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation in a Web or JAX-RS application to enable an OpenID Connect client for that application. The following example shows a servlet with a minimal `@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation when the OP is a Liberty OP:

[source,java]
----
@WebServlet("/OidcAnnotatedServlet")
@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition(
                providerURI = "https://localhost:8920/oidc/endpoint/OP",
                clientId = "clientId",
                clientSecret = "clientSecret",
                redirectURI = "https://localhost:8940/MyApp/Callback",
                claimsDefinition = @ClaimsDefinition(callerNameClaim = "sub", callerGroupsClaim = "groupIds"))
@DeclareRoles("all")
@ServletSecurity(@HttpConstraint(rolesAllowed = "all"))
public class OidcAnnotatedServlet extends HttpServlet {
…
}
----

You can enable the Application Security 5.0 (Jakarta Security 3.0) feature by using the `appSecurity-5.0` feature in the server.xml file:
   
[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>appSecurity-5.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
----


For more information about the `@OpenIdAuthenticationMechanismDefinition` annotation and its attributes refer to the section https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/jakarta-security-spec-3.0.html#openid-connect-annotation[2.4.4. OpenID Connect Annotation] of the Jakarta Security 3.0 specification. Please refer to https://javadoc.io/doc/jakarta.security.enterprise/jakarta.security.enterprise-api/latest/jakarta.security/module-summary.html[Jakarta Security Module] for the documentation of the Jakarta Security 3.0 APIs.

[#faces]
== Jakarta Faces 4.0

Jakarta Faces is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for building web applications. It offers many convenient features, such as state management and input validation.

Numerous changes have occurred since the last Jakarta Faces release. Notably, Pages (formerly JSP) support has been removed. Managed Beans support has also been removed, and developers should use CDI beans from this version forward. The namespaces also have been updated from `http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/*` to `jakarta.faces.*`. Otherwise, new attributes have been added to existing tags: `multiple` and `accept` for `h:inputFile` and `onerror` for `f:websocket`. Developers may now create facelets programmatically rather than building them via XML. Extensionless mapping has been implemented, so URLs no longer need to include `/faces` or `.xhtml` mappings. Two new tags have been added: `f:selectItemGroups` and `f:selectItemGroup` to create a nested collections (i.e., optgroup containing option elements).  These are just some significant changes, but there have been many more.

The `faces-4.0` feature uses MyFaces, but if a developer wishes to use an alternative Faces implementation, such as Mojarra 4.0, that can be accomplished via facesContainer-4.0. The Faces API and implementation jars just need to be included in the application `WEB-INF/lib` folder. 

You can enable the Jakarta Faces 4.0 feature by using the `faces-4.0` feature in the server.xml file:
   
[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>faces-4.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
----

To enable the Jakarta Faces 4.0 feature, add `faces-4.0` to the server.xml file:
[source,xml]
----
    <featureManager>
        <feature>facesContainer-4.0</feature>
    </featureManager>
----

You can find more information regarding the many changes in Faces 4.0 in the https://balusc.omnifaces.org/2021/11/whats-new-in-faces-40.html[What's new in Faces 4.0?] article.  The Javadoc, specification documentation, and other information can be found on the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/4.0/[Faces 4.0] page.

[#mp6]
== MicroProfile 6.0   

MicroProfile 6.0 enables applications to use MicroProfile APIs together with Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile. The complete list of MicroProfile 6.0 specifications includes:

* https://jakarta.ee/specifications/coreprofile/10/[Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile]
* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/releases/tag/3.0.2[MicroProfile Config 3.0]
* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance/releases/tag/4.0.2[MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 4.0]
* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics/releases/tag/5.0[MicroProfile Metrics 5.0]
* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/releases/tag/4.0.1[MicroProfile Health 4.0]
* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-telemetry/releases/tag/1.0[MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0]
* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/releases/tag/3.1[MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.1]
* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/releases/tag/2.1[MicroProfile JWT Authentication 2.1]
* https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client/releases/tag/3.0.1[MicroProfile Rest Client 3.0]

The following specifications in MicroProfile 6.0 release are either new or have some major or minor update when compared to MicroProfile 5.0:

- MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 (new spec)
- MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 (major update)
- MicroProfile OpenAPI 3.1 (minor update)
- MicroProfile JWT 2.1 (minor update)

MicroProfile 6.0 has the following backward incompatible changes compared to MicroProfile 5.0:

- Incompatible changes from MicroProfile Metrics
- MicroProfile OpenTracing replaced by MicroProfile Telemetry
- Includes Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile instead of the five specifications (CDI, Jakarta Restful Web Services, JSON-B, JSON-P and Annotations) in Jakarta EE 9.1

It's also worth noting that MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 has https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-metrics-5.0.0-RC4/microprofile-metrics-spec-5.0.0-RC4.html#_incompatible_changes[incompatible changes] compared to MicroProfile Metrics 4.0.

You can enable the MicroProfile 6 feature by using the `microProfile-6.0` feature in the server.xml file:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>microProfile-6.0</feature>
</featureManager>

[#maxFfdcAge]
== Configurable maximum FFDC age
   
Open Liberty provides First Failure Data Capture(FFDC) capability which instantly collects information about events and conditions that might lead up to a failure.  In certain scenarios, the number of files in the FFDC directory can grow to a very large amount. Currently, Open Liberty will automatically purge FFDC files in excess of 500 and this value was not configurable. This beta release introduces new functionality which automatically purges FFDC log files after reaching a configured age. This is done through a new configuration attribute, `maxFfdcAge`.

`maxFfdcAge` is the maximum desired age before an FFDC file is deleted. At midnight everyday, any FFDC file that has reached the maximum configured age will be deleted. Specify a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be days (`d`), hours (`h`), or minutes (`m`). For example, specify 2 days as `2d`. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, `2d6h` is equivalent to 2 days and 6 hours.
    
Example server.xml configuration:
[source,xml]
----
<server>
    <logging maxFfdcAge="2d"/>
</server>
