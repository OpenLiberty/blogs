[#InstantOn]
== Rapid startup with Liberty InstantOn
   
Performance is one of the core focuses and differentiators of the Liberty runtime. link:{url-prefix}/blog/2019/10/30/faster-startup-open-liberty.html[As far back as 2019], Liberty was able to start up in ~1sec. Since then, Liberty has continued to pursue even faster startup, and this focus on performance has resulted in the InstantOn capability.  Liberty InstantOn enables your applications to start in milliseconds, without compromising on throughput, memory, development-production parity, or Java language features.

To reduce the cost of running applications in the cloud, it is ideal to run the application only when it is needed. Unneeded application instances should be stopped.  As soon as activity increases again, a new application instance needs to start up quickly and respond to incoming requests efficiently. This is known as scale-to-zero.  Applications that take multiple seconds to start cannot scale-to-zero without introducing high latency for the application user.

InstantOn uses the Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace (link:https://criu.org/[CRIU]) feature of the Linux kernel to take a checkpoint of the JVM that can be restored later. With InstantOn, the application is developed as normal, and then InstantOn makes a checkpoint of the application process when the application container image is built. When the application is restored, it runs in the same JVM, which provides complete parity between development and production. Because the checkpoint process takes only seconds, your CI/CD process is barely affected.  The restoration of the image takes only milliseconds, allowing your applications to quickly scale up and down, which provides cost benefits without any negative impacts on the end users.

InstantOn supports Jakarta EE Web Profile versions 8.0 and later, MicroProfile versions 4.1 and later, as well as several other Liberty features. For more information, see the link:{url-prefix}/blog/2023/06/29/rapid-startup-instanton.html[How to package your cloud-native Java application for rapid startup] blog post and the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/instanton.html[Faster startup with InstantOn] documentation.

[#devTools]
== Liberty Tools
The Liberty Tools v23.0.6 are now available! Some highlights include diagnostic and hover support for MicroProfile (3.x and later) and Jakarta EE Web Profile (9.x and later) APIs, as well as various Liberty config files.  The Liberty Tools are available for Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse IDE.

To get started with the Liberty Tools, you can obtain the link to install the tools for your favorite IDE from the link:{url-prefix}/start/[Get started with Open Liberty] page.

[#bugs]
== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A23006+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 23.0.0.6].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25283[JSF Container's Application.getWrapped returns null]
+
The JSF Container features return `null` when `javax.faces.application.Application.getWrapped` method is called. 
+
This issue has been resolved and the correct wrapped object is returned.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25168[transport close timing issue when streams are closing and a close/goaway frame comes in]
+
Since Http/2 and webSocket are full duplex connections, multiple threads might be working at the same time on the same connection.  A timing window existed where one thread is closing down the connection, gets interrupted, and another thread closes the connection.  Then the first thread wakes back up to resources that have already been freed.
+
The error may produce an exception similar to the following:

When posting multipart/form-data to a REST endpoint using the `@FormParam` annotation for an `EntityPart` or `InputStream` parameter, the request fails with a `400 Bad Request` response, and the following exception is logged:

[source]

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24981[server version command ignores JAVA_HOME set in server's server.env]
+
The `server version <serverName>` command ignores the `JAVA_HOME` variable that is set in the server's `server.env` file.
Instead it prints out the Java version info of the Java installation set by `JAVA_HOME` variable in shell environment (bash).
+
This issue has been resolved and the `server version` command now correctly identifies the Java version as specified in the `server.env` file.
