[#Intro]

A few years ago, there was a need to showcase Open Liberty, along with its new features, like MicroProfile and Java EE in a new, cool and interesting way, such as a demo. Hence, https://github.com/fwji[Frank Ji] and I teamed up to accept our mission to build an engaging physical demo that can be used around the world in conferences, and who knew that we would end up building something simply amazing, that would travel across the world to various developer conferences and local developer meetups.

With our vague mission objectives firmly in our sights we set forth to accomplish our task at hand, with many rejected ideas and many sleepless nights, we were finally able to build an awesome cool demo called “Open Liberty Space Sentry Challenge” that covered all the requirements – from artwork to wires, from Arduinos, Raspberry Pis to modern software design with Lego.

[#About]
== What is the Open Liberty Space Sentry Challenge?

Open Liberty Space Sentry Challenge is an interactive Internet of Things (IoT) game designed to showcase Microservices with modern Java technologies in a fun way. The player can take control of a spaceship made of Lego and a 3D printed model using a PlayStation 4 controller/keyboard and shoot lasers. The objective is to shoot down as many randomly popping up targets as possible within 1 minute. At the end of the game, the final score is shown on the screen, along with the player’s position in the leaderboard.

[#Design]
== How it’s made?

The Space Sentry Challenge is built in two separate components; hardware and software, where the communication between the two components is done via Java Socket connections.

=== Hardware component:
The spaceship is 3D printed and is fitted on a 100% Lego 2-axis Pan & Tilt system to power the movement of the Spaceship. The movement of the spaceship is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller and servo motors, which is attached to a Wi-Fi module (ESP8266), that allows communication to be sent over a Wi-Fi connection to Open Liberty. A laser is mounted on the top of the spaceship with blinking LEDs surrounding the base. The spaceship contains custom-designed PCBs to improve the overall reliability of the system.

The Targets array system contains 5 3D printed targets that are situated on a Lego base. Each of the targets contains a Piezoelectric sensor to capture when the laser hits the targets. Like the Spaceship, the target movements are controlled via an Arduino with servo motors attached to it, as well as the communication is established via a Wi-Fi connection.

=== Software component:

There are 3 microservices that make up this game; link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/space-sentry-challenge/tree/master/services/liberty-demo-game[Game Service], link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/space-sentry-challenge/tree/master/services/liberty-demo-leaderboard[Leaderboard Service], and link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/space-sentry-challenge/tree/master/services/liberty-demo-admin[Admin Service]. Each service makes use of the Open Liberty features such as link:guides/rest-intro.html[JAX-RS], link:guides/microprofile-rest-client.html[MicroProfile REST Client], to provide and consume REST APIs for communication between the services and uses the other MicroProfile features such as link:guides/microprofile-config-intro.html[MicroProfile Config], link:guides/microprofile-health.html[MicroProfile Health] and link:guides/microprofile-metrics.html[MicroProfile Metrics] to provide useful capabilities. The final score for the leaderboard is stored in a MongoDB database.

The game can be accessed via a web page in a browser from a static Web application hosted on Nginx.

The services run on Docker containers, within a Raspberry Pi, where a local Wi-Fi network is established for communication.

== Mission Complete!

Since the debut of this game, it has become an instant attraction at various developer conferences and local developer meetups. People loved the mechanics of the game as it was easy to learn but difficult to master. Moreover, it was the idea behind the game of having different technologies working together with the addition of Lego that really helped us reach out to audiences and developers of different technical backgrounds. For people who want to learn Java and microservices using a different approach, you can take a look at our link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/space-sentry-challenge[GitHub repository], where we have our entire project there, including the Lego assembly instructions, Arduino codes, and the Java microservices code, with the required Open Liberty configuration.

[#Future]
== More to come...

With this mission successfully completed, our space adventure journey is not done yet... 
Stay tuned for the next amazing demo build, coming to a galaxy near you!
