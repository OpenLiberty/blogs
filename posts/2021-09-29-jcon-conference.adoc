Despite the global pandemic and general chaos of this year, many amazing developer events and conferences are still taking place virtually, bringing the developer community together once more. One such event that will use a digital format to bring together the international Java community is JCON-Online. The great part is, it's free for all JUG (Java User Group) members!

Several members of the Open Liberty team will be joining https://jcon.one/[JCON-Online 2021] on 5-8 October. If you're also going to be there, deciding which of the great talks to see at JCON looks like it could be a challenge. So we've put together a helpful summary of the sessions on https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile], https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE] and https://openliberty.io/about/[Open Liberty].
