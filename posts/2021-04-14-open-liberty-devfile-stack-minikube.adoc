= Cloud-native development with the Open Liberty devfile stack and Minikube
Adam Wisniewski <https://github.com/awisniew90>

With the Open Liberty devfile stack, you can develop new and existing cloud-native applications link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2021/01/20/open-liberty-devfile-stack.html[directly in an OpenShift cluster]. But what if you don't have access to a remote cluster? No problem! You can still get all of the benefits of stack development locally with Minikube.

Check out a quick demo:

== Minikube

link:https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/[Minikube] is a Kubernetes cluster that runs locally, right on your laptop. It's easy to install, fast to start up, and even comes with a web-based dashboard for viewing and managing your deployments.

== Open Liberty devfile stack

The link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/application-stack#open-liberty-application-stack[Open Liberty devfile stack] provides much of the tooling and infrastructure you need to start developing your application. Open Liberty, Maven, Open J9, and more all come packaged in a development image where you build and run your app. A fully configured link:https://docs.devfile.io/devfile/2.0.0/user-guide/index.html[devfile] describes the dev environment and defines all of the build and run commands behind the scenes. You can just sit back and focus on your code.

== OpenShift Do (odo)

Odo is a simple CLI tool that you use to create stack projects and interact directly with your Kubernetes cluster (in this case, Minikube). Once you link:https://odo.dev/docs/installing-odo/[install odo], you can start creating Open Liberty stack projects and developing right in Kubernetes.

== Set it up

After link:https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[installing Minikube], start your local cluster:

[source,sh]
----
$ minikube start
----

MacOS users might need to start Minikube with a driver other than "docker", due to a known issue with the docker driver and the ingress addon. For example:

[source,sh]
----
$ minikube start --driver=virtualbox
----


Next, enable the Minikube ingress addon:

[source,sh]
----
$ minikube addons enable ingress
----

When you enable the ingress addon, you can create a URL for your app by using an ingress domain.

Start the Minikube dashboard (Optional):

[source,sh]
----
$ minikube dashboard
----

Minikube opens a Kubernetes dashboard in your browser where you can view and interact with your cluster and your development pod.


== Try it out

With Minikube set up, you are now ready to create an Open Liberty stack project. You can either initialize an existing application or use the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/application-stack-starters[stack starter] to create a new app. For this blog, we are going to use the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/application-stack-intro/tree/blog-demo[application-stack-intro] app. This application is a basic JAX-RS sample that uses Maven, Open Liberty, and MicroProfile.

Clone the following repo and switch to the `application-stack-intro` directory:

[source,sh]
----
$ git clone -b blog-demo git@github.com:OpenLiberty/application-stack-intro.git && \
  cd application-stack-intro
----

Create a new namespace in your Minikube cluster:

[source,sh]
----
$ odo project create ol-app-ns
----

Initialize the app as a "java-openliberty" stack project:

[source,sh]
----
$ odo create java-openliberty my-ol-comp
----

You can now see the addition of a `devfile.yaml` file in the project root directory that was downloaded from the default devfile registry. This file is the brains behind the Open Liberty devfile stack and it defines the development environment for your app.

Create a URL for the application by using an Ingress domain:

For convenience, you can use the link:https://nip.io/[nip.io] service to create mappings of your ingress controller to an external IP. Otherwise, you must add the IP to your `etc/hosts` file.

[source,sh]
----
$ odo url create --host $(minikube ip).nip.io
----

Push your app to your local Minikube cluster:

[source,sh]
----
$ odo push
----

Check the output to make sure that your application is up and ready to use:

[source,sh]
----
$ odo log
----

You can look for the following message to verify that the server is up:

`CWWKF0011I: The server defaultServer is ready to run a smarter planet`

To access the application, list the new URL that you created:

[source,sh]
----
$ odo url list

Found the following URLs for component my-ol-comp
NAME                STATE      URL                                              PORT     SECURE     KIND
my-ol-comp-9080     Pushed     http://my-ol-comp-9080.192.168.99.103.nip.io     9080     false      ingress
----

Open a browser to this URL and append `/api/resource` to the end of the URL for the REST endpoint. For example:

`http://my-ol-comp-9080.192.168.99.103.nip.io/api/resource`.

Look for the following screen:

== Start coding!

You are now ready to start coding! After each change to your app, either re-issue `odo push` or run `odo watch` to automatically sync your changes with the pod. That's it!
