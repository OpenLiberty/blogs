== jaxws-2.2 updates to CXF 3.4

   
   
We've updated jaxws-2.2 to use CXF 3.4, which is a huge update coming all way up from CXF 2.6.2. Anyone using jaxws-2.2 will automatically get the update with 22.0.0.8, and you shouldn't see any behavioral changes with this update. On our end, it does make it much easier to keep jaxws-2.2 up-to-date going forward, and you will see a much quicker turn around time on pulling in the latest fixes from CXF and it's related dependencies going forward! 

If you have previously provided this information for an Open Liberty beta blog post and nothing has changed since the beta, just provide a link to the published beta blog post and we'll take the information from there.

[#SUB_TAG_1]
== Time-based log rollover for Liberty

- Liberty provides a few different log files - a message.log is created by default, and a trace.log and http_access.log can be enabled for tracing and NCSA access logs respectively. Previously, these log files could only be rolled over by either server restart, or by limiting the maximum log file size using the `maxFileSize` logging attribute. Instead of file size based log rollover, users may want to roll over their files at periodic times to facilitate their existing log cleaning or archival processes. 
- Now, users have the ability to enable time based periodic rollover of those log files at their own specified time of day using two new optional logging configuration attributes: `rolloverInterval` and `rolloverStartTime`. These rolled log files are complete, and their file names are appended with the timestamp corresponding to when the log was rolled over.
- `rolloverInterval` is the desired time interval between log rollovers. Set the attribute with a positive integer followed by a unit of time, which can be days (d), hours (h), or minutes (m). For example, specify 5 hours as 5h. You can include multiple values in a single entry. For example, 1d5h is equivalent to 1 day and 5 hours.
- `rolloverStartTime` is the time of day when logs should first rollover and begin the first rollover interval duration. Valid values for the attribute follow a 24-hour ISO-8601 datetime format of HH:MM, where 00:00 represents midnight. 
- The two configuration attributes are optional. If neither of the attributes are set, then time based log rollover is not enabled. If only one of the two attributes is set, then time based log rollover is enabled, and the other attribute is set to its default. The default value for `rolloverInterval` is `1d`, and the default value for `rolloverStartTime` is `00:00`.

Example server.xml configuration for `<logging/>`, which handles `messages.log` and `trace.log` (if enabled) rollover:

```
<server>
   ...
    <logging rolloverStartTime="00:00" rolloverInterval="1d"/>
    ...
</server>
```

Example server.xml configuration for access logging, using `<httpAccessLogging/>`, which handles `http_access.log` rollover:

```
<server>
   ...
    <httpAccessLogging rolloverStartTime="00:00" rolloverInterval="1d" logFormat='%h %u %{t}W "%r" %s %b' />
    ...
</server>
```

Example server.xml configuration for access logging, using `<accessLogging/>` under `<httpEndpoint/>`, which handles `http_access.log` rollover:

```
<server>
   ...
   <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint">
      <accessLogging rolloverStartTime="00:00" rolloverInterval="1d" logFormat='%h %i %u %t "%r" %s %b' />
   </httpEndpoint>
    ...
</server>
```

Example logs, rolled over every minute, with a configuration of `rolloverInterval="1m"` and `rolloverStartTime="00:00"`:

[#SUB_TAG_2]
== Separate stack trace from messages in logged exceptions

   
Incorporated as part of the Java's logger API are methods that allow you to include a `Throwable` as a parameter. This new functionality introduced enhances the OpenLiberty's JSON logging and the `logstashCollector-1.0` feature (which forwards JSON logs to an Elasticsearch target server) by introducing two new fields relevant to the `Throwable` object. For OpenLiberty's JSON logging the fields are `ibm_stackTrace` and `ibm_exceptionName`. For the `logstashCollector-1.0` feature the fields are `stackTrace` and `exceptionName`. The _stack trace_ field would present solely the stack trace of the `Throwable`. The _exception name_ field would present the type of exception of the `Throwable`. These fields are only included if the logging record includes a `Throwable` object. This affects the message and trace events for both the OpenLiberty JSON logging and `logstashCollector-1.0` features.

Prior to this enhanced functionality, any logging record originating from a Java Logger which made use of any of the methods that accept a `Throwable` parameter would simply append the stack trace to the existing `message` field.  By keeping the `message` field solely to the logged message and having a unique field for the stack trace and exception type enhances the effectiveness of log analysis tools down stream. Rules and visualizations relevant to these two new exception related fields can be created which results in more stream-lined strategy to identify any issues encountered by the application. There are no configuration steps to enable this functionality and will be present in the OpenLiberty's JSON logging and `logstashCollector-1.0` features.

## Example:
For the example we will only be showing the message log record for OpenLiberty's JSON logging


Application with the following code snippet:
```
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyResource.class.getCanonicalName());
Exception exception = new IllegalArgumentException("ouch");
logger.log(Level.INFO, "exception message", exception);
```

OpenLiberty JSON logging output BEFORE:
```
{
    "type": "liberty_message",
    ...
    "message": “exception message  java.lang.RuntimeException: ouch
	atmy.package.MyResource.get(MyResource.java:32)
	atmy.package.MyResource.get(MyResource.java:20)
...",
    ...
}
```

OpenLiberty JSON logging output AFTER:
```
{
    "type": "liberty_message",
    ...
    "message": “exception message",
    "ibm_exceptionName":"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException",
    "ibm_stackTrace":"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: ouch
	at my.package.MyResource.get(MyResource.java:20)
...",
    ...
}
```

== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A22008S+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 22.0.0.8].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21740[INACTIVITY TIMEOUT VALUE LARGER THAN 2147483 SECONDS CAUSES IMMEDIATE CACHE INVALIDATION]
+
Setting the Inactivity timeout for a distributed map entry to a value larger than 2147483 seconds causes immediate cache invalidation.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21735[PausableComponentException when closing message endpoints on server shutdown]
+
Due to the waitForStop method waiting for the entire duration of the server quiesce time (https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21734), the quiesce operations that occur after it are blocked. This causes the PausableComponentException since the pause operation was delayed until the server quiesce time elapsed. 

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21664[featureUpdate downloads fail in Windows, due to #20945]
+
Cannot connect to Maven repo on Windows due to changes made in #20945. Need to append backsplash instead of File.separator for urls. 
+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21651[290399-Fix umask command for IBM i in server script]
+
Currently, the umask shell script command used in the `server` command on IBM i is biased for QSHELL (`/bin/qsh`).  It uses the extended symbols (namely `-S`) support that not all the other shells on IBM i support.  When running in some of the other shells, an error message message like:
```
umask: bad argument count
```
can show up.  This could mean the file permissions used with an Open Liberty server were incorrectly set.
+
We also see this error message show up in our FAT testing:
```
.../dev/image/output/wlp/bin/server[3]: umask: 0403-008 The number of parameters specified is not correct.
```

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21615[EJB persistent timers that were deferred during app start do not run when app finishes starting]
+
EJB Persistent Timers that get deferred due the application not being started yet do not run after the application finishes starting.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21601[Port MYFACES-4432 to JSF 2.3 and Faces 3.0 (Resolve request object in facelets) ]
+
When using the "@FacesConfig" annotation in a JSF 2.3 or Faces 3.0 application, the _#{request}_ object fails to resolve. An empty string is returned instead. 

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21526[UI generated by `openapi-3.1` feature doesn't show the link specific endpoints]
+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21473[ClassCastException FFDC occurs when using audit-1.0 with other features like requestTiming-1.0 or eventLogging-1.0]
+
A ClassCastException FFDC is output when using the audit-1.0 feature with other features.
+
Here is an example stack from one of the FFDC files:
```

+
`When the server working directory is specified using environment variable SERVER_WORKING_DIR, and when a space is present in the name of the server working directory, an attempt to start the server using the Windows server script will hang, and the server will not start.`

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/20950[Memory Leak with JSF's ViewScopeContextualStorage (MYFACES-4433)]
+
There is a small memory leak in the JSF features. CDI ViewScoped beans are stored within the ViewScopeContextualStorage object, and these beans are removed at the end of their lifecycle. Each new view creates another ViewScopeContextualStorage to store the beans. However, each ViewScopeContextualStorage is not deleted after the view changes. Instead, it's only deleted at session expiration. 
+
Note that this leak is very small, but may still had up over time until the session expires.
