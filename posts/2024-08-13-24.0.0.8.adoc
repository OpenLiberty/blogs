//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
// Do not remove or edit the variables on the lines beneath the author name.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to
// a custom picture, you must provide a custom string for "open-graph-image-alt".
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title eg: MicroProfile 3.3 is now available on Open Liberty 20.0.0.4
// Replace dmuelle with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
// Replace David Mueller with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-04-09-microprofile-3-3-open-liberty-20004.adoc
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark
// backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

RELEASE_SUMMARY

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Leave any instances of `tag::xxxx[]` or `end:xxxx[]` as they are.
//
// Replace RELEASE_SUMMARY with a short paragraph that summarises the release. Start with the lead feature but also summarise what else is new in the release. You will agree which will be the lead feature with the reviewers so you can just leave a placeholder here until after the initial review.
// // // // // // // //

// // // // // // // //
// Replace the following throughout the document:
//   Replace 24.0.0.8 with the version number of Open Liberty, eg: 22.0.0.2
//   Replace 24008 with the version number of Open Liberty wihtout the periods, eg: 22002

== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A24008+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 24.0.0.8].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/29165[Platform OpenAPI endpoints don't set security headers]
+

The following endpoints don't set the `X-Content-Type-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` headers:
`/openapi/platform/config`
`/openapi/platform/validation`
+
These headers instruct a browser fetching these endpoints that the content type should be respected and that the returned pages may not cause the browser to make further requests. When the user agent is not a browser, these headers have no effect.
+
These endpoints serve machine readable OpenAPI documentation in JSON or YAML format which document endpoints presented by the `restConnector-2.0` feature. A user may direct tooling to read the endpoint, or they may download the documentation to use offline.
+
As these endpoints don't serve HTML or Javascript and aren't intended for use by a browser, there isn't really a need for these headers, but there's also no reason not to add them.

Between the two examples, the only difference (aside from unique values in the JWK objects) is a single leading space character that I added to the JWK response in the failing scenario. The Liberty code doesn’t do any kind of trimming on the response back from the server. If the response doesn’t immediately start with a `{` character, we assume we need to Base64 decode the response. Decoding the response ends up producing the junk string that you see in the trace with the exception, and we fail to parse the result as JSON.
