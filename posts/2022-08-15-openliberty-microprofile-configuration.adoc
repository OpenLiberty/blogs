[#Intro]

== What is MicroProfile and Open Liberty

The link:https://microprofile.io[MicroProfile] specification consists of a collection of Enterprise Java APIs and technologies that together form a core baseline for microservices that aims to deliver application portability across multiple runtimes.

link:https://openliberty.io/[Open Liberty] is a lightweight open source Java™ runtime that is built by using modular features. 

== About MicroProfile config and containerization

Externalizing configuration into different file formats like JSON, XML and Java Properties files are a common coding practice to separate application code from the configuration variables. Variables in the source code are initialized from these configuration files at runtime. In this blog, we will be discussing how Open Liberty and MicroProfile manage such configuration requirements.   

MicroProfile and Open Liberty have standardized the use of these configuration sources, please visit link:https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config.html[Configuring microservices], to learn more about configurations in OpenLiberty. Some commonly used configuration sources are; 

             server.xml
             Environment variables
             microprofile-config.properties
             CustomConfig properties (implemented using org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource)

These config sources may contain a special ordinal value to control the order of precedence at runtime.

In many cases, applications need to be hosted in multiple environments like development, test and production. Some of the configuration may need to set differently depending on the environment and platform, whereas some may remain the same. In a containerized environment, there are number of different configuration methods, such as;

            Configuring through environment variables
            Configuring through ConfigMap
            Configuring through Secrets
            Configuring through configuration file in a volume

When values of variables configured on environment variable, configmap and secrets are changed, application pod will be restarted to complete the injection, but that's not the case with configuration through volume. 

Architecture diagram of Open Liberty config files flow from GitHub through a build tool to Kubernetes is as given below

== Different data injection methods in Kubernetes/OpenShift

There are multiple ways to inject data into application containers. This blog will discuss those methods one by one. The commands given in this blogs are OpenShift commands, but you can run the same on Kubernetes by replacing 'oc' by 'kubeclt'

For the purpose of demonstration, i have defined variables in below given files and the values for the same is injected from different container data sources.

server.xml&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

==== Configuring through environment variables

Container pods can define environment variables in deployment configuration. Users can configure these environment variables to use it in the application on run time. 

In this section, i will demonstrate how to configure the environment variables in container environment, from UI as well as from deployment configuration yaml code. Users can change these environment variables either manually or automated to feed the new variable values into the container (when environment variable is changed, associated pod will be restarted).

image::/img/blog/OpenShift-deployment.png[OpenShift environment variable view,width=70%,align="center"]

        containers:
          - resources: {}
            terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
            name: libertyapp
            env:
              - name: MPConfig
                value: micro profile  test config
              - name: SerEnv
                value: server env test config
              - name: Custom-Config
                value: Custom config param
              - name: Server-Config
                value: server config
              - name: Boot-config
                value: boot config
            ports:
              - containerPort: 9080

When the container is restarted, the values from this environment variables are injected into application in the container, a sample result is show below

=== Config Map

A ConfigMap is a configuration store in containerization platform. It store configurations in key-value format. These configmap's can be injected into container pods which will be used by the hosted application on run time. 

In this section i will explain the steps to create configmap and configure the same on container to inject the values into the hosted application.

Create a configmap in Kubernetes/OpenShift

            apiVersion: v1
            kind: ConfigMap
            metadata:
              name: config-env-file
            data:
              MPConfig: "micro profile  test config"
              SerEnv: "server env test config"
              Custom-Config: "Custom config param"
              Server-Config: "server config"
              Boot-config: "boot config"

            oc create -f configmap.yaml 

ConfigMap is created in Kubernetes/OpenShift

Now map the configmap to the container pod for injecting into the associated application 

From UI:

YAML defenition

          containers:
            - resources: {}
              terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
              name: libertyapp
              env:
                - name: MPConfig
                  valueFrom:
                    configMapKeyRef:
                      name: config-env-file
                      key: MPConfig
                - name: SerEnv
                  valueFrom:
                    configMapKeyRef:
                      name: config-env-file
                      key: SerEnv
                .
                .
                .      
              ports:
                - containerPort: 9080
                  protocol: TCP

Successful configuration injection would give results like given below

=== Config as Secrets

OpenShift/Kubernetes secrets stores/displays the configurations in encrypted format. Sensitive data's can be stored as secrets in Kubernetes/OpenShift and map the same to environment variable in POD to inject the same to the associated application. 

In this section, i will explain the steps to create secrets in OpenShift/Kubernetes and map the same to a pod. 

Create an OpenShift/Kubernetes secret following the steps in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/secrets.html[create secret]

Eg: oc create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server="https://index.docker.io/v1/" --docker-username=“” --docker-password=“” --docker-email=*

Secret is created on OpenShift

Now map the secret to environment variable as the data source and access the variable from the application.

Successful configuration injection would give results like given below

=== Config file in Volumes - Avoiding application restart

Volumes are the persistent storage facility on containerization platforms like Kubernetes/OpenShift. Application pods can be configured to map this volume to the  containers hence any files copied to volumes from external to container will be available inside the container. In kubernetes, volumes can be created by following the steps in link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[Kubernetes Persistent Volume], creating volume is very straightforward in OpenShift. An example code which shows how a volume can be mapped to the pod and mount to the container is given in the below screenshot

image::/img/blog/config-in-volume-mount.png[ConfigMap in volume - yaml view ,width=70%,align="center"]

In this method of configuration management, you need to create environment variables in OpenShift/Kubernetes manually or with automated steps as explained in the above sections. 

Developers need to write the timer based code to read the configuration file copied from external to internal volume and process the same and update the new values to the mapped environment variable. Since the change in environment variable values are set from inside the application itself, there is no need of an application restart to reflect the change across the application 

== Managing configurations files through different Kubernetes environments

Applications deployed on multiple environments like DEV, QA and PROD will have environment specific configuration files. These environment specific configurations will have to be managed by associates whose access would be limited to specific environments. I will explain a simple way to manage environment specific files storage, packaging and deploying across different environments.

=== DEV enviornment 

On DEV environment, all the common config files and DEV specific config files will be stored on Git on a separate branches (not along with the source code repository, a separate repository can be created for configs - in this way, we can stop exposing the source code to non-DEV team).  

On Build tool (like jenkins),  We should create a build job as well as configuration update job. This seperate configuration update job on build tool would be useful when we need to update only the configurations in the container and no application deployment need to be done. Build job will do the application build, scan and packaging and upload the docker image to the image repository. 

The below given diagram states the full build/deployment flow on DEV environment. Please note that config update on container DEV environment can be done manually as well

Use commands similar to below given to copy files to pods from local
*kubectl cp /tmp/samplefile.txt <container-namespace>/<pod-id>:/tmp/*

image::/img/blog/dev-cluster1.png[Configuration management and deployment on DEV environment ,width=70%,align="center"]

=== QA environment

On QA environment, it's not mandatory to do the code build again. For application deployment, QA team can setup the deployment config in the QA container prior and initiate the redeployment of the image from the build tool. In case of a new image deployment, QA team can update the new image details in container deployment config manually or programmatically from the build job  

To update any configurations from DEV branch to QA branch, DEV team can initiate a pull request and on approval from QA team, it can be merged to QA branch. QA team can directly update any QA environment specific configurations to the configs on QA branch 

image::/img/blog/qa-cluster1.png[Configuration management and deployment on QA environment ,width=70%,align="center"]

=== PROD environment

on PROD environment, deployment pattern is same as on QA environment, PROD team can setup the deployment config in the PROD container prior and initiate the redeployment of the image from the build tool or manually. In case of a new image deployment, PROD team can update the new image details in container deployment config manually or programmatically from the build job 

To update any configurations from QA branch to PROD branch, QA team can initiate a pull request and on approval from PROD team, it can be merged to PROD branch. PROD team can directly update any production environment specific configurations to the configs on PROD branch 

image::/img/blog/prod-cluster1.png[Configuration management and deployment on production environment ,width=70%,align="center"]

== Conclusion

Configurations update through volumes can be done using manual shell script executions from container terminal. Many teams do the code build and packaging for QA and PROD deployment as well, like wise there would be alternatives for every methods explained in this blog. This blogs is an opinionated one, please approach it accordingly .
