In 21.0.0.3, we have a milestone update to the MicroProfile feature with a major version increase to 4.0. This includes updates to all 8 MicroProfile components: Config, Fault Tolerance, Health, JWT RBAC, Metrics, Open API, Open Tracing and Rest Client. To utilize these updated components, run your app with the latest version of Open Liberty.

If you're feeling curious about what's coming soon in Open Liberty, take a look at the 'beta status' features in the latest development builds, for example LDAP connection support for Kerberos authentication is now available in the Open Liberty 21.0.0.4-beta release.

== Significant bugs fixed in this release

As well as adding support for MicroProfile 4.0, we've also spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A21003+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 21.0.0.3].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/15927[Fix the injection of Optional Lists and Sets (MP Config)]
+
Previously, a bug in Open Liberty's mpConfig-1.x features meant it was not possible to inject an `Optional<List<String>>` or `Optional<Set<String>>` using `@ConfigProperty`. This issue has now been fixed and there should be no issues injecting optional Lists and Sets.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/12215[Read jvm.options file from the intended directory]
+
According to the link:[Open Liberty documentation] the `jvm.options` file is intended to be read from the `${wlp.user.dir}/shared/jvm.options` directory to allow for custom JVM options to be loaded. Prior to Open Liberty 21.0.0.3, this file was erroneously fetched from the `${WLP_INSTALL_DIR}/usr/shared/jvm.options` path. This behaviour has now been corrected.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/15853[Update Netty to 4.1.59.Final (gRPC Client 1.0)]
+
Due to a vulnerability discovered in link:https://netty.io/[Netty] client/server framework a security update has been pushed to Open Liberty 21.0.0.3, going from version 4.1.52.Final to 4.1.59.Final. The discovered vulnerability (link:https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2[CVE-2021-21290]) would not have affected any Open Liberty code but the precautionary measure to update has been taken to maintain high security standards.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/15744[Update to Apache MyFaces 2.3.8]
+
The `jsf-2.3` feature in Open Liberty makes use of link:https://myfaces.apache.org/core23/index.html[Apache MyFaces] JavaServer Faces implementation. With the release of Apache MyFaces 2.3.8 a number of improvements and bug fixes have been made, for more information visit the link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10600&version=12349324[Apache MyFaces 2.3.8 changelog].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/11249[Fix memory leak when applications do not close JAXRS Client objects]
+
Prior to Open Liberty 21.0.0.3, an issue within JAXRS existed where `Client` objects would not be properly disopsed of when their use had expired, thus causing a memory leak. The cause of this was `JAXRSClientImpl` keeping a hard reference to the client so preventing it from being picked up by garbage collection; this behaviour has since been corrected. For more information view the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/20.0.0.12/reference/feature/jaxrsClient-2.1.html[JAX-RS 2.1 documentation].
