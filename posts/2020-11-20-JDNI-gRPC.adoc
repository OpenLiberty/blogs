=== Support for Custom JNDI Names for Enterprise Beans

==== What is Support for Custom JNDI Names for Enterprise Beans?

Support for Custom JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) Names for Enterprise Beans (EJBs) is an enhancement to all existing enterprise beans features that allows an application to configure and use custom JDNI names for looking up and/or injecting enterprise beans, and to also use legacy default JNDI names from WebSphere traditional.

Prior to this enhancement, Liberty only supported looking up enterprise beans using the specification define JNDI names : `java:global/<app>/<module>/<bean>!<interface>` & variations for `java:app` and `java:module`.

Without any additional configuration, the default JNDI names that were available on WebSphere traditional are now available for applications to use to lookup and/or inject enterprise beans. Also, rather than using the defaults, a custom name for each EJB may be specified in the `ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xml` file (or `ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xmi` file for EJB 2.x and 1.x modules). This file is the same format as used by WebSphere traditional. These new JNDI name options are available in addition to the existing specification required names.

==== Easier Migration for Enterprise Bean Applications

Custom JNDI name support for enterprise beans provides an easier migration path for applications from other platforms (including WebSphere traditional).

Prior to Java EE 6, the Enterprise Beans specification did not prescribe the JNDI names required for enterprise beans, so every platform provided platform specific default names and custom binding file formats. Since Liberty only supported the specification defined JNDI names, migrating applications from other platforms often requires code changes to modify the platform specific JNDI names to the newer specification defined names.

Since Liberty now supports the same default JNDI names, and same binding file format as WebSphere traditional, code changes to modify the JNDI lookup names are no longer required when migrating EJB applications from WebSphere traditional to Liberty.
Migration from other platforms is also simplified because applications may be migrated without changing code, but instead migrating the other platform specific binding files to the new Liberty platform specific binding file format.

==== Application Configuration details

Full details about the legacy default bindings provided, as well as the syntax for declaring custom JNDI names in the ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xml file, including examples, may be found in link:https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_9.0.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/cejb_bindingsejbfp.html[this IBM Knowledge Center article].

Custom bindings may be configured for an application in the following three locations.

===== Specify Custom bindings in ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xml for EJB 3.x

Following are examples of how to configure custom bindings for EJB 3.x beans in an EJB JAR module or WAR module in `ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xml`

Specify a binding per interface:

----
   <session name="NoInterceptorBasicStateless">
      <interface class="com.ejbs.InventoryService" binding-name="ejb/Inventory"/>
   </session>
----

Specify a component id (a prefix for default long form bindings)

----
   <session name="AccountServiceBean" component-id="Dept549/AccountProcessor"/>
----

Simple binding name (one name used for both local and remote)

----
   <session name="AccountServiceBean" simple-binding-name="ejb/AccountService"/>
----

Local and Remote home specific binding names

----
   <session name="AccountServiceBean" local-home-binding-name="ejblocal:AccountService"/>
   <session name="AccountServiceBean" remote-home-binding-name="ejb/services/AccountService"/>
----

===== Specify Custom bindings in server.xml

Following is an example of how to configure custom bindings for EJB 3.x beans in an EJB JAR module or WAR module in `server.xml` in the `<application>` or `<ejbApplicationd>` elements:

----
   <ejbApplicationlocation="EJBTest.jar">
      <ejb-jar-bnd>
         <session name="InventoryServiceBean">
            <interface class="com.ejbs.InventoryService" binding-name="ejb/Inventory"/>
         </session>
      </ejb-jar-bnd>
   </ejbApplication>
----

===== Specify Custom bindings in ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xmi for EJB 1.x/2.x

Following is an example of how to configure custom bindings for EJB 1.x or 2.x beans in an EJB JAR module in `ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xmi`

EJB 1.x and 2.x provide a single JNDI name that applies to both the remote and local home:

----
   <ejbBindings xmi:id="BeanBinding_8" jndiName="suite/r6x/base/misc/poollimits/SLCMTTxTimeoutHome">
      <enterpriseBean xmi:type="ejb:Session" href="META-INF/ejb-jar.xml#SLCMTTxTimeout"/>
   </ejbBindings>
----

For a bean with both a remote and local home, the above will provide the following custom bindings:

----
   Remote Home : suite/r6x/base/misc/poollimits/SLCMTTxTimeoutHome
   Local Home  : local:suite/r6x/base/misc/poollimits/SLCMTTxTimeoutHome
----

==== Feature configuration details

Support for custom and legacy default JNDI names is enabled by default for all Enterprise Bean (EJB) features. This support will not interfere with the existing specification defined `java`: support. However, it is possible to completely disable the new support with the following setting in server.xml:

----
    <ejbContainer bindToServerRoot=“false"/>
----

It is also possible to disable just the legacy short form default JNDI name support (i.e. the bean is bound using the interface name) with the following setting in server.xml:

----
   <ejbContainer disableShortDefaultBindings=“true"/>
----

Since the new support for customer JNDI names and legacy defaults provider alternative JNDI names, it is now possible to disable the EJB specification required JNDI names. This is done in server.xml as follows:

----
   <ejbContainer bindToJavaGlobal=“false"/>
----

Finally, the following new configuration attribute on the `<ejbContainer>` element in open-liberty enables the WebSphere traditional behavior of failing application start when multiple beans are bound to the same JNDI name:

----
    <ejbContainer customBindingsOnError=“FAIL"/>
----

[#TAG_2]
== Provide and consume gRPC services from your web applications

link:https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/[gRPC] is a high-performance, open source universal RPC framework. gRPC support on Liberty allows developers to both provide and consume gRPC services from your web applications. The introduction of gRPC support in Open Liberty now means you can take advantage of the benefits of gRPC more easily than before. Those benefits include great performance, simple service definitions via Protocol Buffers, cross-platform and language support, and wide industry adoption.

These two features which were previously in our beta are now available in this months GA: `grpc-1.0`, which enables gRPC services, and `grpcClient-1.0`, which enables the use of a gRPC client for outbound calls.

The `grpc-1.0` feature works by scanning web apps for gRPC service implementations, through implementors of `io.grpc.BindableService`. The web app must include the protocol buffer compiler-generated code for the services it intends to provide, and additionally the service class must provide a no-argument constructor. The web app does not need to include any core gRPC libraries; those are provided by the Liberty runtime. Once a gRPC service is scanned and started, it becomes accessible to remote gRPC clients on the configured HTTP ports.

The `grpcClient-1.0` feature provides applications with access to a link:https://netty.io/[Netty] gRPC client, as well as the related libraries. A web app must provide a client implementation and stubs, and can make outbound calls with a `io.grpc.ManagedChannel` without needing to provide the supporting client libraries.

You can now sample gRPC by either following the instructions in this link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-grpc[GitHub repositories] README or following this basic Hello World service (add the  `grpc-1.0` to the `server.xml`):

[source, java]
----
package com.ibm.ws.grpc;

import com.ibm.ws.grpc.beans.GreetingBean;

import io.grpc.examples.helloworld.GreeterGrpc;
import io.grpc.examples.helloworld.HelloReply;
import io.grpc.examples.helloworld.HelloRequest;
import io.grpc.stub.StreamObserver;

public class HelloWorldService extends GreeterGrpc.GreeterImplBase {

    public HelloWorldService(){}

    @Override
    public void sayHello(HelloRequest req, StreamObserver<HelloReply> responseObserver) {
        HelloReply reply = HelloReply.newBuilder().setMessage("Hello " + req.getName()).build();
        responseObserver.onNext(reply);
        responseObserver.onCompleted();
    }
}
----

For this example, the application must provide the link:https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/examples/src/main/proto/helloworld.proto[helloworld protof definition] along with the protobuf compiler output. No additional libraries need to be provided with the application, and once it's started the helloworld greeter service will be accessible on the server's HTTP endpoints.

For a client example, a basic Servlet using gRPC can be defined via `grpcClient-1.0` with:

[source, java]
----
package com.ibm.ws.grpc;

import io.grpc.examples.helloworld.GreeterGrpc;
import io.grpc.examples.helloworld.HelloReply;
import io.grpc.examples.helloworld.HelloRequest;

import io.grpc.ManagedChannel;
import io.grpc.ManagedChannelBuilder;
...
@WebServlet(name = "grpcClient", urlPatterns = { "/grpcClient" }, loadOnStartup = 1)
public class GrpcClientServlet extends HttpServlet {

        ManagedChannel channel;
        private GreeterGrpc.GreeterBlockingStub greetingService;

        private void startService(String address, int port) 
        {
            channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress(address , port).usePlaintext().build();
            greetingService = GreeterGrpc.newBlockingStub(channel);
        }

        private void stopService() 
        {
            channel.shutdownNow();
        }

        @Override
        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest reqest, HttpServletResponse response) 
            throws ServletException, IOException 
        {

            // set user, address, port params
        }

        @Override
        protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) 
            throws ServletException, IOException 
        {

        // grab user, address, port params
        startService(address, port);
        HelloRequest person = HelloRequest.newBuilder().setName(user).build();
        HelloReply greeting = greetingService.sayHello(person);

        // send the greeting in a response
        stopService();
        }	
    }
}
----

As with the service example, the application must provide the link:https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/examples/src/main/proto/helloworld.proto[helloworld protof definition] along with the protobuf compiler output. All required gRPC client libraries are provided by `grpcClient-1.0`.

== Significant bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A20.0.0.12+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 20.0.0.12].


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14542[IllegalAccessError when using MP Rest Client with Java 15]
+
There was a MP Rest Client failure when running with Java 15. This was fixed by changing the visibility of the `compareCustomStatus` method to public. If you would like to know more about MP Rest Client check out our link:https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-rest-client.html[Cunsuming RESTful services with template interfaces] and link:https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-rest-client-async.html[Consuming RESTful services asynchronously with template interfaces] guides.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14650[MP GraphQL does not scan JARs in WEB-INF/lib for GraphQL components]
+
Classes annotated with things like `@GraphQLApi`, `@Type`, etc. or types referenced from root level queries that exist in JARs in the WEB-INF/lib directory were not processed. This meant that only classes in the WEB-INF/classes directory were processed by the MP GraphQL runtime. 


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14582[Prevent jsonp-1.0 and jsonpContainer-1.1 from both starting]
+
When both `jsonp-1.0` and `jsonContainer-1.1` were both configured at the same time it would cause an error. This issue was fixed by preventing these to start at the same time by throwing an error. the fix can be found link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/pull/14583[here].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14597[Increased CPU when moving from Liberty 19.0.0.6 to newer releases]
+
When moving from 19.0.0.6 to a newer release, there was an issue with an increase in CPU. This was caused by a fix for a previous issue which made the processing of Audit features method arguments to be peformed whether the feature was enabled or not. This issue was fixed by moving the method parameters to a location where the formatting is acutally used.
