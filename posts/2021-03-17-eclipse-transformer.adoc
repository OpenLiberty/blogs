= Enabling Jakarta EE 9 for development and test by using the Eclipse Transformer
Thomas Bitonti <https://github.com/tbitonti>

== Overview

In this post, we describe how to use the Eclipse Transformer to update your applications and test artifacts for Jakarta EE 9. We also describe the steps to update Open Liberty server configurations to run Jakarta EE 9 applications.

The core problem that is introduced by Jakarta EE 9 is the renaming of package prefixes from `javax` to `jakarta` for APIs and properties. As a consequence, existing applications that run against Java EE 7 or Jakarta EE 8 do not run against Jakarta EE 9. To run existing applications as Jakarta EE 9 applications, specific package references must be updated.

To solve this problem, the Open Liberty development team created the https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.transformer[Eclipse Transformer]. This open source project provides a utility that updates package references in various artifacts.

The development team uses the Eclipse Transformer to update bundle implementation archives. The team also uses the transformer to update test artifacts, including applications, test classes, and Open Liberty server configurations.

Similarly, you can use the Eclipse Transformer to update applications, test classes, and server configurations. Updates to applications and test classes are usually necessary. Updates to server configurations are necessary when using Open Liberty.

The transformer is quick and efficient. When integrated as a build step, as is done in Open Liberty builds, using the transformer avoids the creation of new Jakarta EE 9 source files.

Although this post focuses on updating from Jakarta EE 8 to Jakarta EE 9, the same information holds true for updating from Java EE 7 to Jakarta EE 9.

== Test transformation strategy

To transform test artifacts, package references must be updated to change old `javax` package references into new `jakarta` package references. Package references can be in several locations, including test applications, test code, and server configurations.

Additionally, in Open Liberty, server configurations must be updated to replace old Jakarta EE 8 features with corresponding new Jakarta EE 9 features. Currently, the transformer does not have the rules data necessary to specify feature name updates. These updates must either be made manually, through custom code, or by creating new rules data for the transformer. For more information about updating Open Liberty features, see <<#features,Updating Open Liberty features in server configurations>>.


== Preparing to run the transformer

A transformer image can be obtained either by downloading the image or by building an image by using the open source repository.

* Top-level link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.transformer/downloads[downloads links] are available within the project pages.
* Several current link:https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/eclipse/transformer/org.eclipse.transformer.cli/[snapshots] are usually available.

Alternatively, the transformer can be built by cloning the link:https://github.com/eclipse/transformer[Eclipse Transformer repository] and invoking maven to build the transformer JAR file:
[source]
--
    mvn clean package
--
The maven build creates the distribution JAR file at:
[source]
--
    org.eclipse.transformer.cli/target/org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.jar
--

Unzipping the downloaded or built distribution obtains the transformer and prerequisite JAR files:

[source]
--
    unzip org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.jar
--

[source]
--
    org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    libs/org.eclipse.transformer-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    libs/biz.aQute.bnd.transform-5.2.0.jar
    libs/slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar
    libs/commons-cli-1.4.jar
    libs/slf4j-simple-1.7.30.jar
--

== Running the transformer

The Eclipse Transformer can be run directly from the command line, as a Gradle task, or from Java code. This post describes using the transformer from the command line. For more information, see the link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.transformer[transformer project pages].

To run the transformer by using the default rules, run the following command:

[source]
--
  java -jar org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    <target_location> \
    <output_location>
--

The target location can be a packed application archive file (EAR, WAR, RAR, or JAR) or a directory that contains the fully or partially expanded contents of one of these archives. The target can also be a directory that contains Java source, or a directory that contains several application archives. It can even be a single file, such as a `server.xml` file. The transformer processes all of the artifacts in the target location. Transformed artifacts are written to the output location.

The `org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file is a runnable JAR file that specifies `org.eclipse.transformer.jakarta.JakartaTransformer` as the main class and uses the necessary JAR files from the `libs` folder in its class path.

You can run the transformer using custom rules by specifying options on the command line. The additional options specify local rules files that the transformer uses instead of the default rules files.

For example, to use Open Liberty rules data, which can be more up to date than the default rules data, download link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/tree/integration/dev/wlp-jakartaee-transform/rules[Open Liberty Rules]. Then, pull in the downloaded rules data by adding options `-tr`, `-td`, and `-tf`, to the command-line invocation:

[source]
--
  java -jar org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    <target_location> \
    <output_location> \
    -tr ${rules}/jakarta-renames.properties \
    -td ${rules}/jakarta-direct.properties \
    -tf ${rules}/jakarta-xml-master.properties
--

The `-tr` option specifies a properties file that contains package rename data. The `-td` option specifies a properties file that contains java direct string replacement data. The `-tf` option specifies a main properties file that links to other properties files. Each of the linked properties files contains replacement data for text-like files that match specific patterns, as specified in the main properties file.

These three command-line options are most important for application and test developers. Other command line options are available, but are less important. For example, the option `-tb` is used to specify data for transforming bundle archives, while the option `-ts` is used to specify which target files are to be transformed. For more information about command-line options, run the transformer with either the `-usage` option or with the `-help` option.

[source]
--
  java -jar org.eclipse.transformer.cli-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    -usage
--

=== Transforming server configurations

When you specify your `server.xml` file as a target location for the transformer, Open Liberty server configuration elements that contain `javax` package references are updated to `jakarta`. For example, the `destinationType` attribute of the `jmsActivationSpec` element contains a `javax` package reference:

[source]
--
  <jmsActivationSpec id="SharedSubscriptionWithMsgSel/TestTopic1">
    <properties.wasJms
        destinationRef="jms/FAT_TOPIC"
        destinationType="javax.jms.Topic"
        subscriptionDurability="DurableShared"
        clientId="cid1"
        subscriptionName="DURSUB"/>
  </jmsActivationSpec>
--

This configuration is updated to:

[source]
--
  <jmsActivationSpec id="SharedSubscriptionWithMsgSel/TestTopic1">
    <properties.wasJms
        destinationRef="jms/FAT_TOPIC"
        destinationType="jakarta.jms.Topic"
        subscriptionDurability="DurableShared"
        clientId="cid1"
        subscriptionName="DURSUB"/>
  </jmsActivationSpec>
--

Only package names in the server configuration are updated by the transformer. Features must be handled separately

[#features]
== Updating Open Liberty features in server configurations

For Jakarta EE 9 applications to run in Open Liberty, new Jakarta EE 9 features must be specified in the server configuration. In many cases, the new Jakarta EE 9 features use the same short names as the corresponding Jakarta EE 8 features. In those cases, the Jakarta EE 9 features simply have an updated feature version. For example, `cdi-2.0` was updated to `cdi-3.0`. However, in some cases, the feature short name is also different, as with `ejb-3.2`, which was updated to `enterpriseBeans-4.0`.

If an old short name is incorrectly used with a new Jakarta EE 9 version, the server does not start, and the server logs provide information to say which new feature short name must be used. For example, if `ejb-3.2` is incorrectly changed to `ejb-4.0`, the server logs indicate that `enterpriseBeans-4.0` must be used.

Currently, the transformer cannot update Open Liberty features because it is missing rules data to specify the updates. Features must be updated manually or by custom code.

The following table lists features for which only the feature version is updated:
