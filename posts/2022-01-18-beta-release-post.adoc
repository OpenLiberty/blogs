Open Liberty 22.0.0.2-beta offers just one new feature, supporting new changes in SSL certificates with urlencoded strings. 

[#allbeta]
== All Beta Features package
The All Beta features package for link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] contains all Open Liberty beta features and GA features and functions.

This means that you can now try out our in-development Open Liberty features by just adding the relevant coordinates to your build tools.

If you try the beta package, <<feedback, let us know what you think>>.

The following beta features are available in 22.0.0.2-beta:

* <<ssl, Support new change in the SSL certificate with urlencoded string>>

[#ssl]
=== Support new change in the SSL certificate with urlencoded string

An `X.509` certificate is a digital certificate which is used to manage identity and security in internet communications and computer networking.

The `X.509` certificate can be sent by the intermediate servers (like web server, proxy server or load balancer) to an application server. Due to the deprecation of long lines folding in the `HTTP` header continuation, some of the open source intermediate servers start sending a client certificate in the Privacy-Enhanced Mail (`PEM`) url-encoded certificate to application server.

Currently, WebSphere Application Server and Liberty Server do not support this new url-encoded certificate. Any request with this new format is rejected and the request is terminated.

An example of a truncated url-encoded certificate sent to application server:app-name:

Note: 

* (1) The header (i.e BEGIN ) and footer (i.e END) information are appended before sending to application server.
* (2) The encoded character (i.e %) presents in the certificate.

The IBM application server code is updated to auto detect and process this new format.
