https://devnexus.org/[DevNexus], the longest-running and largest Java Conference in the USA will be happening this year in Atlanta, GA, from April 12-14. As in-person conferences make a comeback in 2022, this will be a great opportunity to re-connect with the Java community.

And of course, members of the Open Liberty team will be on-site hosting multiple sessions and running demonstrations and labs in the IBM booth. If you're also going to be there, deciding which of the great talks to see can be a bit of a challenge. So we've put together a helpful summary of the sessions on https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile], https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE] and https://openliberty.io/about/[Open Liberty].
