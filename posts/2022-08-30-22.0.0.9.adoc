// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appriopriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it

// Replace TITLE with the blog post title eg: MicroProfile 3.3 is now available on Open Liberty 20.0.0.4
// Replace mbroz2 with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
// Replace Michal Broz with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-04-09-microprofile-3-3-open-liberty-20004.adoc

// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark
// backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is

// In the preceding section:
// Leave any instances of `tag::xxxx[]` or `end:xxxx[]` as they are.
//
// Replace RELEASE_SUMMARY with a short paragraph that summarises the release. Start with the lead feature but also summarise what else is new in the release. You will agree which will be the lead feature with the reviewers so you can just leave a placeholder here until after the initial review.

// // // // // // // //
// Replace the following throughout the document:
//   Replace 22.0.0.9 with the version number of Open Liberty, eg: 22.0.0.2

[#SUB_TAG_0]
== Password Utilities 1.1

   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
```
The new passwordUtilities-1.1 feature has been created to no longer start the federatedRegistry-1.0 feature or the JCA / connectors features. The new feature is part of core edition, whereas the passwordUtilities-1.0 feature is part of base edition.
```
   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
```
Stand-alone user registries will no longer be forcefully federated, which sometimes results in slightly different behavior. The password utilities APIs can now be used in core edition.
```
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
```
Add the passwordUtilities-1.1 feature to the list of features in the server.xml file:

<featureManager>
    <feature>passwordUtilities-1.1</feature>
</featureManager>
```
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A22009S+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 22.0.0.9].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/22040[Invalid character warning for colon in WorkQueueManagerImplMBeanWrapper objectName ]
+
A colon character in the Apache CXF WorkQueueManagerImplMBeanWrapper class's objectName creates a warning and a javax.management.MalformedObjectNameException caused by the invalid ':' character when javax.management.ObjectName.construct is called. This issue occurs in Open Liberty 22.0.0.8 when it did not appear in 22.0.0.7.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21973[Expiration fields are not compared in an LTPA Token]
+
When there are two expiration times present in an LTPA token, the times should be compared to be within an acceptable difference.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21955[Liberty does not provide exported packages for java.* packages at runtime in the OSGi framework insteance]
+

Starting with OSGi R7 Core specification, bundles are allowed to import (using `Import-Package` header) packages from `java.*` (e.g. `java.io`).  When installing a liberty feature that includes a bundle that imports a `java.*` package the bundle cannot resolve.  The reason the bundle cannot resolve is because Liberty does not configure the OSGi framework (Equinox in this case) to export the `java.*` packages available in the running JVM.

+
When the IBM JDK is being used not all protocols in a list of protocols will get honored.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/21845[featureUtility - Not decoding repository passwords when executing]
+
When executing the featureUtility on `kernel-slim` images when ever we set overrides for the mavenCentralMirror or a secondary repository and we use the securityUtility to {xors}, {hash} or {aes} encode the passwords, authentication is failing to those end servers with http 401 forbidden. Replace it with the actual passwords in `plain text` and it works again.

Original bug from here https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-open-api/issues/543
 Based on open liberty and MicroProfile OpenAPI [2.0.1], We want to display example for date-time field as this format  "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" in the web html, so we  Sechema defined as bellow in Java code:
@Schema(name = "created_at", format = "date-time")
@Schema(name = "last_updated_at", format = "date-time", example = "2018-03-20T09:12:28Z")
@Schema(name = "started_at", format = "string", example = "2018-03-20T09:12:28Z")

== New and updated guides since the previous release
As Open Liberty features and functionality continue to grow, we continue to add link:https://openliberty.io/guides/?search=new&key=tag[new guides to openliberty.io] on those topics to make their adoption as easy as possible.  Existing guides also receive updates in order to address any reported bugs/issues, keep their content current, and expand what their topic covers.
