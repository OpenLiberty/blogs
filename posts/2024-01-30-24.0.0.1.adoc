   <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

Open Liberty InstantOn provides fast startup times for MicroProfile and Jakarta EE applications. InstantOn support has been added to the following features:

- Jakarta and Java XML Web Services (24.0.0.1)
- Jakarta and Java Mail (23.0.0.10)
- Admin Local Connector (23.0.0.11)

InstantOn support has been added to additional versions of the following features:

- Java Database Connectivity (23.0.0.9)
- Application Security (23.0.0.10)
- Password Utilities (23.0.0.10)

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

InstantOn supports a subset of the Open Liberty features.  Any public features that are enabled outside of the supported set of features for InstantOn cause the checkpoint to fail with an error message. As of the 24.0.0.1 release, in addition to the set of features included initial Liberty InstantOn 23.0.0.6 release, the following features have been enhanced to support InstantOn:

- `jaxws-2.2` (24.0.0.1)
- `xmlWS-3.0` (24.0.0.1)
- `xmlWS-4.0` (24.0.0.1)
- `jdbc-4.1` (23.0.0.9)
- `jdbc-4.3` (23.0.0.9)
- `appSecurity-1.0` (23.0.0.10)
- `javaMail-1.6` (23.0.0.10)
- `mail-2.0` (23.0.0.10)
- `mail-2.1` (23.0.0.10)
- `passwordUtilities-1.0` (23.0.0.10)
- `localConnector-1.0` (23.0.0.11)

This enables applications that use these features to be deployed using Open Liberty InstantOn.

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

A Liberty InstantOn checkpoint and restore can now be performed with a Liberty server configured with the features that have been enhanced for InstantOn support.

   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/27093[mpMetrics-5.0 Feature Returns Response in ISO-8859-1 Instead of UTF-8 when Accessing /metrics Endpoint]
+
When enabling the `mpMetrics-5.0` feature in Open Liberty to support MicroProfile Metrics 5.0, there is an issue with the character encoding of the response returned from the `/metrics` endpoint. Instead of responding with the expected UTF-8 encoding, the server erroneously returns the response in ISO-8859-1 encoding. As a consequence of this encoding issue, non-ASCII characters included in the `# HELP` section of the response are becoming garbled. `mpMetrics-4.0` and `mpMetrics-3.0` respond with UTF-8 correctly.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/25612[Missing packages in public feature doc]
+
The feature list generator (which is used by the old Liberty Eclipse tools and by the doc generator) doesn't roll up the `IBM-API-Package` and `IBM-SPI-Package` headers from private features to public features. The reason for this is that many private features are referenced from multiple public features so it ended up with a lot of public features showing non-core API that was enabled. This means that when the legacy tools tried to work out what features to enable in `server.xml` they often got it wrong because they had no hint of which one was best. So we moved the headers to the relevant public feature and stopped the rollup.
+
Over time it seems that this knowledge has been forgotten and the `IBM-API-Package` and `IBM-SPI-Package` have been pushed down into private features. This means these packages are hidden in generated doc which isn't great. A list of private features with these is below:
