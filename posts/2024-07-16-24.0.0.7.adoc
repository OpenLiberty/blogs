== Enhanced histogram and timer metrics in MicroProfile 3.0 and 4.0

This release introduces MicroProfile Config properties for MicroProfile 3.0 and 4.0 that are used for configuring the statistics that are tracked and outputted by the histogram and timer metrics. These changes are already available in MicroProfile Metrics 5.1.

In previous MicroProfile Metrics 3.0 and 4.0 releases, histogram and timer metrics tracked only the following values:

* Min/max recorded values
* The sum of all values
* The count of the recorded values
* A static set of percentiles for the 50th, 75th, 95th, 98th, 99th, and 99.9th percentile.

These values are output to the `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format.

The new properties can define a custom set of percentiles as well as custom set of histogram buckets for the histogram and timer metrics. Other new configuration properties can enable a default set of histogram buckets, including properties that define an upper and lower bound for the bucket set.

With these properties, you can define a semicolon-separated list of value definitions that use the following syntax:

----
<metric name>=<value-1>[,<value-2>â€¦<value-n>]
----

Some properties can accept multiple values for a given metric name, while others can accept only a single value.

You can use an asterisk ( *) as a wildcard at the end of the metric name.

[cols="2*"]
|===
| Property  | Description
| mp.metrics.distribution.percentiles | Defines a custom set of percentiles for matching Histogram and Timer metrics to track and output. Accepts a set of integer and decimal values for a metric name pairing. Can be used to disable percentile output if no value is provided with a metric name pairing.
| mp.metrics.distribution.histogram.buckets| Defines a custom set of (cumulative) histogram buckets for matching Histogram metrics to track and output.  Accepts a set of integer and decimal values for a metric name pairing.
| mp.metrics.distribution.timer.buckets| Defines a custom set of (cumulative) histogram buckets for matching Timer metrics to track and output.  Accepts a set of decimal values with a time unit appended (that is, ms, s, m, h) for a metric name pairing.
|mp.metrics.distribution.percentiles-histogram.enabled | Configures any matching Histogram or Timer metric to provide a large set of default histogram buckets to allow for percentile configuration with a monitoring tool. Accepts a true/false value for a metric name pairing.
| mp.metrics.distribution.histogram.max-value| When percentile-histogram is enabled for a Timer, this property defines an upper bound for the buckets reported. Accepts a single integer or decimal value for a metric name pairing.
| mp.metrics.distribution.histogram.min-value| When percentile-histogram is enabled for a Timer, this property defines a lower bound for the buckets reported. Accepts a single integer or decimal value for a metric name pairing.
|mp.metrics.distribution.timer.max-value | When percentile-histogram is enabled for a Histogram, this property defines an upper bound for the buckets reported. Accepts a single decimal value with a time unit appended (that is, ms, s, m, h) for a metric name pairing. Accepts a single decimal value with a time unit appended (that is, ms, s, m, h) for a metric name pairing.
|mp.metrics.distribution.timer.min-value | When percentile-histogram is enabled for a Histogram, this property defines a lower bound for the buckets reported. Accepts a single decimal value with a time unit appended (that is, ms, s, m, h) for a metric name pairing.

|===

You can define the `mp.metrics.distribution.percentiles` property similar to the following example.

----
mp.metrics.distribution.percentiles=alpha.timer=0.5,0.7,0.75,0.8;alpha.histogram=0.8,0.85,0.9,0.99;delta.*=
----

This property creates the `alpha.timer` timer metric to track and output the 50th, 70th, 75th, and 80th percentile values. The `alpha.histogram` histogram metric outputs the 80th, 85th, 90th, and 99th percentile values. Percentiles for any histogram or timer metric that matches with `delta.*` are disabled.

We'll expand on this example and define histogram buckets for the `alpha.timer` timer metric by using the `mp.metrics.distribution.timer.buckets` property.

----
mp.metrics.distribution.timer.buckets=alpha.timer=100ms,200ms,1s
----

This configuration tells the metrics runtime to track and output the count of durations that fall within 0-100ms, 0-200ms and 0-1 seconds. This output is due to the histogram buckets working in a _cumulative_ fashion.

The corresponding prometheus output for the `alpha.timer` metric at the `/metrics` REST endpoint is similar to the following example:

----
# TYPE application_alpha_timer_mean_seconds gauge
application_alpha_timer_mean_seconds 2.9700022497975187
# TYPE application_alpha_timer_max_seconds gauge
application_alpha_timer_max_seconds 5.0
# TYPE application_alpha_timer_min_seconds gauge
application_alpha_timer_min_seconds 1.0
# TYPE application_alpha_timer_stddev_seconds gauge
application_alpha_timer_stddev_seconds 1.9997750210918204
# TYPE alpha_timer_seconds histogram <1>
application_alpha_timer_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"} 0.0 <2>
application_alpha_timer_seconds_bucket{le="0.2"} 0.0 <2>
application_alpha_timer_seconds_bucket{le="1.0"} 1.0 <2>
application_alpha_timer_seconds_bucket{le="+Inf"} 2.0 <2> <3>
application_alpha_timer_seconds_count 2
application_alpha_timer_seconds_sum 6.0
application_alpha_timer_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 1.0
application_alpha_timer_seconds{quantile="0.7"} 5.0
application_alpha_timer_seconds{quantile="0.75"} 5.0
application_alpha_timer_seconds{quantile="0.8"} 5.0
----

<1> The Prometheus metric type is `histogram`. Both the quantiles/percentile and buckets are represented under this type.
<2> The `le` tag represents _less than_ and is for the defined buckets, which are converted to seconds.
<3> Prometheus requires that a `+Inf` bucket counts all hits.

== Learn to develop applications with Open Liberty in the new "Essentials for Cloud-Native Java Application Development" course

The link:https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/essentials-for-java-application-development-with-liberty[Essentials for Cloud-Native Java Application Development] course is published on the link:http://cognitiveclass.ai/[cognitiveclass.ai] site.

This course teaches you the essential skills and technologies to create a basic cloud-native Java application with Open Liberty. You'll learn about REST applications, contexts and dependency injection (CDI), externalizing application configuration, and more. If you score 80% or higher on the final quiz (20 multiple-choice questions), you'll receive the link:https://www.credly.com/org/ibm/badge/liberty-developer-essentials[Liberty Developer Essentials] badge from Credly.
