[#Intro]
== What is DevOps
DevOps is a culture or a process which enables the integration of the software development (dev) and IT operations (ops) which will facilitate the setup of deployment pipeline as well as helps to improve the speed of software delivery. Automation of the entire build, test and deployment of the software applications can be achieved through DevOps process. There are tons of efficient applications and process methodologies available in the market which can be readily integrated to the DevOps pipeline which will help to achieve the desired results. 

== CI/CD and Jenkins
CI/CD are acronym's for contineous integration and contineous delivery/deployment used in DevOps. Contineous integration is a process where developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository and kick start code build, security scan and test execution using automation or manual methods. Contineous delivery/deployment is a process of application deployment into deployment destination.

Jenkins is an opensource automation server which helps to automate application code build, test and deployment. Jenkins comes with a vast variety of plugins which eases the various devops pipeline tool integrations into the build/deployment pipeline. In this blog, we will focus on how jenkins can be used as a piller of contineous integration and contineous deployment process for java based openliberty application deployment link:https://openliberty.io[OpenLiberty] along with GitHub, Helm and IBM Cloud kubernetes service (IKS)  

== Getting ready
Below given is a generic architecture of a simple one dimensional devops pipeline (single environment view).

image::/img/blog/liberty-devops-generic-architecture.png[Liberty devops generic architecture diagram ,width=70%,align="center"]

Setup the GitHub repository with the ideal branching strategy.   
Install jenkins with all the recommended plugins, make sure that the following plugins are installed

* Maven
* Pipeline
* Helm (not a plugin, but install helm on master or any jenkins slave server )
* Docker
* Kubernetes

In general case, we will need a docker image store repository to push the docker image from local docker repo (on Jenkins master or slave node) for referring in deployment configurations, its not mandatory if we can use local image registry (like in openshift). For this purpose, create a custom image registry in IBM cloud or docker repositories can be created in tools like artifactory (open source softwares for this purpose are DockerHub, GitLab container registry, Nexus repository etc).  

Credential store server like vault and docker image scan server like aqua should be ready for the service (if you are not using any hosted services). 

Apart from IKS, there are sevaral choices for the containeirzation question and we can choose any of them for the purpose. Azure kubernetes service (AKS), Amazon EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) etc are some of the cloud services we can opt for, we can setup the kubernetes on our own data center as well. Veryfiy if the kubernetes context can be configured correctly to connect to particular cluster/namespace based on the environment choice (kubectl config current-context). i.e, on run time, if a deployment need to be done to QA cluster or namespace and this choice is done based on the run time parameters, then kubectl commands to redirect to required destination for proper deployments. 

== Creating pipeline script and integrating it with jenkins jobs
Setup the required credentials in jenkins (like dockerhub creds, artifactory api creds, IKS api token, github personal access token etc), either directly on jenkins or integrate external credential store applications like Vault to Jenkins and use the credentials from the same in Jenkins build jobs.  
Credentials can be created from link:http://localhost:8080/credentials/store/system/domain/_/newCredentials[Jenkins] (sample page).

For adhering to the concept of infrastructure as a code (IaaC), use pipeline or multibranch pipeline type jenkins job for the CI/CD process. Only CLI commands can be used in pipeline code, on the other side, free style and maven type job have the advantage of UI based configuration.
Pipeline code syntax can be found at link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world/[pipeline syntax]. On jenkins, use this page to generate pipeline code link:http://localhost:8080/job/pipeline_test/pipeline-syntax/[Jenkins] (sample page).

Pipeline code can be directly written on jenkins job or saved on Jenkinsfile in github and map the same onto the newly created jenkins pipeline type job. For using multi branch pipeline job, the plugin "Multibranch Scan Webhook Trigger" need to be installed on jenkins which will help to trigger the mapped jenkins on any change on github code.

Create multiple stages in pipeline code for source code (SCM) checkout, code build, security scan and helm command execution etc. Jenkins job can be executed on jenkins master itself or on containerized slave (setup done using kubernetes pod template) or on virtual servers. The selection of this execution environment are based on the size of the application.

== Code build, packaging and security scan 
After declaring the jenkins slave label and other variables, create a stage for code checkout into the jenkins workspace, and then initiate the code build using maven commands (Multiple stages on pipeline is only for segrating the activities). For resolving dependencies from any private maven repository (like nexus or artifactory), use the maven settings files uploaded in "managed files" or as secret files (this is not required if your firewall allows to resolve the dependencies from maven central repository). There could be requirements to store the generated war file to a private repository, we will have to use settings file setup for this as well.  

After the code build and unit test execution (we can enable and disable unit test execution through the tags configured on application pom.xml), liberty application code should be packaged to .war file. You can consider the common practices like persistent storage of code package in nexus/artifactory because of various reasons like organizations compliance requirements or to directly download it to docker container while deployment thus by avoiding the risk of exposing application code in case of a compromized docker image. Application jar upload to nexus/artifactory can be done on runtime using distributionmanagement tag in maven pom.  

Running automatic security scan of source code and dependency jars along with every code build is a good practice which can be implemented as part of CI/CD pipeline which ensures the security of the every version of deployed application. Static code analysis and opensource jar scan should be completed before proceeding to deployment. Static code analysis can be done using tools like SonarQube, features like quality gate can be used to fail the code build in case of not satisfying the required code quality and coverage. Dependency jar file scan can be done with tools like nexusiq or checkmarx or you can scan the docker image using the tools like Aqua or Synk. Maven build command can be integrated with scan related CLI commands or these can be done on a different pipeline stage.

When code packaging is completed and ready for deployment, the current branch of code can be added to a git tag for any rebuilding purpose. This can be inititad from jenkins itself.  

== Docker image
When the appliction packaging process is completed, next stage should be to manage the docker image generation and its storage. Docker is a prerequistite for this phase (through the jenkins plugin or directly installing on jenkins master node).

As explained earlier, you have various repository options like dockerhub, IBM cloud registry, artifactory etc for the storage purpose.
All the credentials to use in this stage and further shall be saved and retrieved either directly on jenkins or integrate jenkins with vault (or any other credential store) and retrive the credentials from it. For vault-jenkins integration, you can use "HashiCorp Vault" jenkins plugin.

Docker image can be generated by running CLI command on the directory where the "Dockerfile" is available (command is give below). When the docker build is successfull, an image is created in the local docker repository.  

* docker build -t <docker-image-name>:<version> --build-arg <arg-name>=<arg-value> .

Below given is a glimpse of activities like code checkout, code build, deployment artifact storage, docker image build. In this example, code package is directly embedded into the docker image which is easy though but not recommended. 

image::/img/blog/pipeline-code-example.png[pipeline code example ,width=70%,align="center"]

Next step is to push this local image to a remote repository from where the IBM cloud Kubernetes service can pull this for creating the containers. 

Some helpful cli commands to use in Jenkins are given below (use any Jenkins plugins for the same if available):

* docker login <repository host name> -u "${USERNAME}" -p "${PASSWORD}"
* docker tag <docker-image-name>:<version> <repository host name>/<repository name>/<docker-image-name>:<version>
* docker push <repository host name>/<repository name>/<docker-image-name>:<version>

If cloud authentication and cluster selection is required, use the API key authentication method

* ibmcloud login --apikey <ibm cloud api key> -g <ibm cloud resource group>

== Deployment (CLI and Helm) 
Helm is a good option to facilitate the application deployment on the cloud platform, it eases deployment/maintenance steps and hence highly recommended. But we can do the application deployment on kubernetes using CLI commands directly from Jenkins shell or pipeline stages. 

=== CLI Deployment
When a Docker image is generated and saved on a repositories like K8s/OCP registry, IBM cloud remote registry, artifactory etc, then the docker deployment is very straightforward using kubernetes CLI commands. Either you can generate new image tag on every docker build and update this new name/tag on the deployment yaml file on GitHub (using git push) or you can depend on a single image name/tag for a particular feature release and change it to new on every subsequent release (This change can be done only on the current jenkins workspace file as well if not required to save the information on the github for reference purpose, also if multiple repositories are used for code and container configurations, this push method is helpful).  

As explained in the earlier section, after the kubernetes context is set to the required environment, run the kubectl commands to deploy and components like deployments, services, route, serviceaccount, secrets etc. The yaml files should be already available in the current Jenkins workspace downloaded as explained in the earlier stage (if code and container are part of same repository).   

link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/[Kubernetes sample commands] 

=== Helm deployment
In this stage, we are ready for starting the application deployment using Helm link:https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm/[Helm]. Helm is already available from jenkins server (or on any attached jenkins slave - if we are using virtual machine as the slave, make sure helm is installed on that server and available for all users, if containerized slave are used, make sure the helm installation is done through the dockerfile of the attached image to the slave)

All the deployment related configirations, like, Pod, deployment, service should be completed and checked into github prior to appliction deployment trigger in the helm chart directory link:https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_create/[Helm create]

Run the "helm install" or "helm upgrade" from Jenkins shell or pipeline code to create the resources in the kubernetes cluster. Maintain all the helm resources in a separate folder in the git repository and make the modifications as per the requirement.

The name of the new docker image generated on the docker build can be updated on the helm file on run time (if you are adopting to this run time image name change strategy), you can use the "Git Push Plugin" for this purpose on Jenkins. 

Some helpful cli commands for using in Jenkins are given below

* ibmcloud plugin install container-service
* ibmcloud config --check-version=false
* ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <ibm cloud cluster id>
* helm uninstall <release name> -n <namespace>
* helm install <release name> . --namespace <namespace>

link:https://phoenixnap.com/kb/helm-commands-cheat-sheet[Helm commands]

Use the kubectl commands to  check the status of deployment or go to the kubernetes dashboard and check the status of the deployment

== QA testing options
Apart from running JUnit test cases along with the code build phase, we can configure jenkins and deployment configurations to trigger the funtional/integration QA test cases automatically after the deployment in each environment. 

Configure the test cases on jenkins job and test it manually. Create an "Authentication Token" in "Trigger builds remotely" section under "Build Triggers". Trigger this test case from docker "entrypoint" file using remote rest api call using this authentication token as the identifier

Eg: curl -I -u <auth-token> https://<jenkins-host>/job/<job-name>/build?token=<authentication-token>
Note: Auth token can be generated from postman
