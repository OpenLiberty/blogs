Java SE 19 and MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0 are released this month so we bring you previews of both in this Open Liberty 22.0.0.10-beta. Java 19 provides several new and changed features, including record patterns and virtual threads. MicroProfile Telemetry provides a standards-based set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs.

Also in this beta, the Jakarta XML Binding tools, `xjc` and `schemagen` have been repackaged for Jakarta XML Binding 4.0, and you can now expose SPI interfaces as BELL services and inject properties into BELL services. In a previous beta, we introduced distributed security caches which has now been updated so that you no longer need to include the `distributedSecurityCache-1.0` feature in your `server.xml`.

The link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] 22.0.0.10-beta includes the following beta features (along with link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/feature-overview.html[all GA features]):

* <<java, Java SE 19 support>>
* <<microprofile, Create and manage traces, metrics, and logs using OpenTelemetry open standards (MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0)>>
* <<xml, Repackaging of tools for XML binding (Jakarta XML Binding 4.0)>>
* <<bell, Expose SPI interfaces as BELL services and inject properties into BELL services>>
* <<security, Distributed security caches>>

== Create and manage traces, metrics, and logs using OpenTelemetry open standards (MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0)

link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile/releases/microprofile-telemetry-1.0/plan[MicroProfile Telemetry 1.0] adopts OpenTelemetry from CNCF to allow MicroProfile applications to benefit from OpenTelemetry and enable automatic tracing of Jakarta RESTful web services if configured.

To use this feature update your `server.xml`: 
[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpTelemetry-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----

You can view the telemetry data from your application in link:https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.37/monitoring/#traces[Jaeger] and link:https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html[Zipkin]. To export your traces to one of these exporters, configure the exporter with system properties, e.g. `-Dotel.traces.exporter=jaeger` or environment variables, e.g. `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=jaeger`.  You can also configure the exporter endpoints using `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT`.  To specify the name of the service, use `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`.

[#xml]
== Repackaging of tools for XML binding (Jakarta XML Binding 4.0)

Jakarta XML Binding 4.0 is an API for automating the mapping between XML documents and Java objects when writing XML documents in Java. By and large, the xmlBinding-4.0 feature is identical to xmlBinding-3.0, with a couple of exceptions. The 4.0 spec has removed the deprecated `jakarta.xml.bind.Validator API`. This means, if your application is using Validator to validate your JAX-B data types, you'll need to update to use the more common schema validation method. Here's an example of how to move from the Validator to schema validation: 

To enable the Jakarta XML Binding 4.0 feature, add the `xmlBinding-4.0` feature to your `server.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>xmlBinding-4.0</feature>

[#bell]
== Expose SPI interfaces as BELL services and inject properties into BELL services
The link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/bells-1.0.html[Basic extensions using Liberty libraries (BELL) 1.0] feature enables shared libraries to provide implementations of Liberty API interfaces using Java link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[ServiceLoader] configuration files.

22.0.0.10-beta introduces two capabilities for BELL services: SPI visibility, and properties configuration and injection. Previously these capabilities were available only to user feature extensions. User features offer more capabilities than BELL services, but come with a more complex development model. These capabilities allow extension developers greater opportunity to leverage the simplicity of BELL services.

BELL SPI visibility makes feature SPI packages visible only to shared libraries referenced in BELL configurations. The introduction of BELL SPI visibility enables developers to provide implementations of SPI interfaces as BELL services rather than user features, which typically require more time to develop.

BELL properties configuration and injection enables BELL services to receive properties configured in the server.xml file. The introduction of BELL properties allows users to exploit the benefits of the Liberty configuration and obviates the need to configure BELL services with environment variables or JVM system properties.

To enable SPI visibility declare Boolean attribute `spiVisibility=“true”` in your BELL configuration. SPI visibility is disabled by default.

To specify properties add a `<properties/>` element within your BELL configuration and declare one or more `name="value"` attributes. Properties are type `String` and apply to all services provided by the referenced library.

The configuration below enables SPI visibility for services provided by shared library `ServletExtLib` and declares two properties, `servletName` and `servletMapping`:

[source, xml]
----
<library id=”ServletExtLib">
    <fileset dir="${server.output.dir}/sharedLib" includes="ServletExtLib.jar" />
</library>

<bell libraryRef=”ServletExtLib”
        service="javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer"
        spiVisibility=”true">
    <properties servletName=“RestSciServlet” servletMapping="/rest/*" />
</bell>
----

In order to receive properties at runtime, modify your service implementation classes by defining either a public constructor or a public method named `updateBell`, each having a single parameter of type `java.util.Map<String,String>`. The `updateBell` method is intended to support non-destructive updates and must tolerate multiple calls on the same service instance.

The example below defines method `updateBell` within service implementation class `RestSci`:

[source, java]
----
package my.servlet.extensions;
...    
public class RestSci implements javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer {
    public RestSci() {}

    public void updateBell(java.util.Map<String, String> properties) { 
        // Collect properties 
    }
    ...
}
----
At runtime the server will make SPI packages visible only to a specialized classloader for library `ServletExtLib`. Applications can declare `commonLibRef="ServletExtLib"` in their `<classloader/>` configuration, but they will not see SPI packages. Regarding `<properties/>` the server will inject an unmodifiable map with `key=value` pairs `"servletName"="RestSciServlet"` and `"servletMapping"="/rest/*"` into all services when created during startup and after BELL configuration updates.

=== Bringing up a BELL service that implements the REST Handler SPI interface

The following steps describe how to bring up a BELL service that implements the REST Handler SPI interface `com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.RESTHandler`, which was impossible until now.

. Create the service resource and implementation class files.
+
The resource file is named for the SPI interface and declares the fully-qualified name of the implementation class. The minimal resource file content is shown below. Notice the file also declares an OSGi property required by the RESTHandler interface -- the entry starting with `#` -- that enables the REST Handler framework to register the service as a listener for a specified URL sub-root. In this example the URL sub-root is `/bellEP`.
+
[source, java]
----
#com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.root=/bellEP
your.org.rest.example.BellEndpoint
----
+
A skeletal implementation of SPI interface `com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.RESTHandler`. The implementation defines method `updateBell` to receive BELL properties. The `updateBell` method is intended for non-destructive updates and must tolerate multiple calls on the same service instance. Below is the skeletal implementation:
+
[source, java]
----
package your.org.rest.example;
import com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.*;
...
public class BellEndpoint implements com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.RESTHandler {
    public BellEndpoint() {}
    public void updateBell(java.util.Map<String, String> properties) {...}
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(RESTRequest request, RESTResponse response) {...}
}
----
+
Package the files into a JAR file, say `RestEpLib.jar`:
+
[source, java]
----
META-INF/services/com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.RESTHandler
your/org/rest/example/BellEndpoint.class
----

. Configure the server.
+
The restConnector-2.0 feature enables the REST Handler framework and exports the REST Handler SPI package required by the BELL service. Access to REST endpoints requires secure transport (`transportSecurity-1.0`) and that a user is mapped to the administrator role. Add the following features to the `server.xml`:
+
[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <feature>bells-1.0</feature>
    <feature>restConnector-2.0</feature>
    <feature>transportSecurity-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----
+
Now add the shared library and BELL. The following configuration enables SPI visibility for the `RestEpLib` library and declares one property, `hello="WORLD"`. Enable SPI visibility whenever a BELL service implementation requires SPI packages exported by a configured feature(s). Remember to copy file `RestEpLib.jar` to the directory specified in the library's `<fileset/>`. The stated configuration below:
+
[source, xml]
----
<library id=”RestEpLib">
    <fileset dir="${server.output.dir}/sharedLib" includes="RestEpLib.jar" />
</library>

<bell libraryRef=”RestEpLib”
        service="com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.RESTHandler"
        spiVisibility=”true">
    <properties hello=“WORLD” />
</bell>
----
+
Add the keystore for transport security and map a user to the administrator role:
+
[source, xml]
----
<keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="keystorePassword" />
<basicRegistry>
    <user name="you" password="yourPassword" />
    <group name="yourGroup" />
</basicRegistry>
<administrator-role>
    <user>you</user>
    <group>yourGroup</group>
</administrator-role>
----

. Save your changes and start the server.
+
Look for messages CWWKL0059I and CWWKL0050I in server logs indicating the server enabled BELL SPI visiblity and registered the BELL service. The server makes REST Handler SPI packages visible to a unique classloader for library `RestEpLib`. Applications may declare a common library reference to `RestEpLib` (`commonLibRef="RestEpLib"`) in their `<classloader/>` configuration, but they will not see SPI packages.
+
[source, xml]
----
[...] 00000001 com.ibm.ws.classloading.bells.internal.Bell                  I BETA: BELL SPI Visibility and BELL Properties has been invoked by class com.ibm.ws.classloading.bells.internal.Bell for the first time.
[...] 00000001 com.ibm.ws.classloading.bells.internal.Bell                  I CWWKL0059I: BELL SPI visibility is enabled for the RestEpLib library. The BELL references the RestEpLib library through a unique class loader that can see SPI packages.
[...] 00000001 com.ibm.ws.classloading.bells.internal.Bell                  I CWWKL0050I: The RestEpLib library registered the service that is declared in the wsjar:file:/<your_wlp>/usr/servers/bell_ep_server/sharedLib/RestEpLib!/META-INF/services/com.ibm.wsspi.rest.handler.RESTHandler file, using your.org.rest.example.BellEndpoint implementation class.
----
+
When the server registers the BELL service with the OSGi framework it triggers the REST Handler framework to register the service as a listener for URL sub-root `/bellEP`. The /bellEP endpoint is now accessible.
+
You can now make calls to `https://<host>:8020/ibm/api/bellEP`.
+
The REST handler framework references the BELL service to serve the `/bellEP` endpoint. During the first reference the server creates an instance of class BellEndpoint and injects an unmodifiable map with key/value pair `"hello"/"WORLD"`. The server injects BELL properties at service creation and after BELL configuration updates.

[#security]
=== Distributed security caches
Distributed security cache support has been introduced so that multiple Liberty servers can share caches via a JCache provider. Prior to this feature, the authentication (subject) and logged out cookie caches were restricted to be local and in-memory. Multiple servers were unable to benefit from their peers' caches and each server started with a cold cache. As part of this feature, both caches can be stored in a distributed JCache provider. This can improve performance and failure recovery, reduce the load on backend user registries, and improve the security posture of the server.

You can find out more in our link:{url-prefix}/blog/2022/03/17/graphql-22004-beta.html#security_caches[Open Liberty 22.0.04-beta blog post] but note the following changes:

1. It is no longer necessary to enable the `distributedSecurityCache-1.0` feature in the `server.xml`.
2. The `libraryRef` attribute has been replaced by two attributes: `jCacheLibraryRef` and `commonLibraryRef`. The `jCacheLibraryRef` references the library that contains the JCache caching provider implementation. The `commonLibraryRef` is optional and can reference libraries that contain any custom classes that may be serialized and stored in the cache (define multiple libraries by separating them by a comma).
+
[source,xml]
----
<cachingProvider libraryRef="JCacheProviderLib,CustomLib" />
----
+
is now:
+
[source,xml]
----
<cachingProvider jCacheLibraryRef="JCacheProviderLib" commonLibraryRef="CustomLib" />
----

[#run]
=== Try it now 

To try out these features, just update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 19, Java SE 18, Java SE 17, Java SE 11, and Java SE 8, however, the Jakarta EE 10 features are only compatible with Java SE 11 and later.
