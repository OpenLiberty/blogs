== Fast iterative development with Liberty Tools

Liberty Tools 23.0.6 are now available for use by Java developers to write cloud-native applications with Liberty.

Liberty Tools support popular integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse IDE, Visual Studio Code, and IntelliJ IDEA, allowing developers to focus on their code and rapidly iterate by using Liberty's link:/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode] in their preferred IDE. Moreover, Liberty Tools provide editing assistance for developers to easily make changes to the Liberty configuration files, and coding assistance for writing applications using Jakarta EE (9.x and later) and MicroProfile (3.x and later) APIs.

Learn more about link:/docs/latest/develop-liberty-tools.html[Liberty Tools] and download them from different IDE marketplaces:

== Build, package, and run easily with Liberty Maven & Gradle plugins

Liberty build plugins enable developers to easily build and package their applications to run on Liberty using the popular Java build tools, Maven and Gradle. It's always recommended to use the latest versions of these build plugins to ensure you have the most recent fixes and enhancements, Liberty Maven Plugin 3.8.2 and Liberty Gradle Plugin 3.6.2. For example, in Liberty Gradle Plugin 3.6, we added support for Gradle 8.x. For more information, see link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/releases[Liberty Maven Plugin release notes] and link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/releases[Liberty Gradle Plugin release notes].

To use Liberty Maven Plugin 3.8.2, specify the following configuration in your Maven build file:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.2</version>
</plugin>
----

To use Liberty Gradle Plugin 3.6.2, specify the following configuration in your Gradle build file:

[source,gradle]
----
apply plugin: 'liberty'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.6.2'
    }
}
----
