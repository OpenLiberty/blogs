:toc: preamble


In the data-driven age of AI and cloud computing, the choice between relational or NoSQL databases crucially influences a solution's success. The Jakarta NoSQL specification addresses this challenge by providing a standard-based, easy-to-learn framework that mirrors the familiar JPA and  simplifies development across various NoSQL databases. Learn about the JNopo game and delve into how Jakarta NoSQL, together with Jakarta Data, can simplify using NoSQL databases.


After getting an overview about Jakarta NoSQL, Jakarta Data, and Eclipse JNoSQL in this link:../../../2024/05/03/simplifying-nosql-database-integration-with-jakarta-nosql.html[blog post], we're in a good shape to explore and understand what an actual application implementation with Jakarta NoSQL would look like, through a sample game application that relies on non-relational storage and data manipulation.

== Getting started: playing JNopo!

*JNopo* is a Java version of the famous the _Rock, Paper, and Scissors_ game. This game consists of a battle of two players where each one chooses a move between rock, paper, or scissors. Hopefully you're already familiar with the rules of this game, but if you are not, we've included some example scenarios to illustrate the game logic below. Let's suppose that a _Player A_ will play with a _Player B_ and, in this case:

* If _Player A_ chooses _ROCK_ and _Player B_ chooses _SCISSORS_ then _Player A_ wins the game.
* If _Player A_ chooses _PAPER_ and _Player B_ chooses _ROCK_ then _Player A_ wins the game.
* If _Player A_ chooses _SCISSORS_ and _Player B_ chooses _PAPER_ then _Player A_ wins the game.
* If _Player A_ and _Player B_ choose the same move, then the game is a tie and neither player wins.

In the following sequence diagram, we can illustrate the default behavior of the JNopo game:

[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/jnopo-sequence-diagram-without-persistence.gif[JNopo Sequence Diagram, align="center" width=60%]

JNopo is implemented using Jakarta EE Specifications so it's compatible with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile runtimes. In our case, we're using link:https://openliberty.io/[Open Liberty] 23.0.0.10.

The architecture for this application is comprises two components:

* The web page where the players interact with the game

* The back-end where the game matches are managed

In the following image, we can see the system design of the JNopo game:

=== It's fun time: Let's play JNopo!

Before you start, this game uses the Maven Wrapper plugin, which means, you just need to have the *JDK 21* or later installed in your machine to build and/or run the application.

Yeah! It's time have fun playing JNopo!

Clone the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-jakartaNoSQL-game[Git repository]:

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-jakartaNoSQL-game.git

cd sample-jakartaNoSQL-game
----

Navigate to the `start` directory. This directory contains the starting project that we'll work through in this post.

[source, bash]
----
cd start
----

This project is ready to run on Open Liberty. You just need to perform the following Maven Wrapper command:

* For Mac or Linux:

+
[source, bash]
----
./mvnw liberty:dev
----

* For Windows:

+
[source, powershell]
----
mvnw.cmd liberty:dev
----

This will install all required dependencies and start the default server.

Now, if everything works, you can play the game by accessing the following URL address:

[source, curl]
----
http://localhost:9080/jakarta-nosql-game/
----

To play the game locally you just need to open two browsers tabs/windows pointing to the same URL address.

== The winner ranking challenge

This is where things get interesting: why not to challenge us to learn, create, and improve our knowledge and practical software development skills? That's we're going to do: let's make JNopo provide a winner ranking!

This challenge is an amazing opportunity to learn and explore how to use Jakarta NoSQL and Jakarta Data to simplify NoSQL integration with Java applications.

To get a winner ranking, JNopo needs to persist the game matches results and then summarize the results composing the ranking. To expose this ranking, the application must provide a REST API like the following example:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  http://localhost:9080/jakarta-nosql-game/api/playoffs/ranking
----

The winner ranking response is similar to the following JSON output:

[source, json]
----
{
  "data" : {
    "Max": 2,
    "Fabio": 1
  }
}
----

As I said, it'll be interesting!

== Implementing the winner ranking

The winner ranking requires a set of game matches results. To get that, we need to add a persistence layer to JNopo that captures and stores the game match results.

=== Setting up the persistence layer

Let's add the dependencies to create the persistence layer. Our persistence layer will be implemented using Jakarta NoSQL and Jakarta Data. To implement these Jakarta EE specifications, we'll use link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.jnosql[Eclipse JNoSQL].

Eclipse JNoSQL offers a database API collection that covers document, key-value, column and graph NoSQL databases. For now, Eclipse JNoSQL supports about https://www.jnosql.org/docs/supported_dbs.html[30 NoSQL databases].

For this challenge, let's develop the persistence layer to integrate with document NoSQL databases type. Eclipse JNoSQL supports various document NoSQL databases. You can find a list of supported databases, along with their configurations and dependencies, on the https://github.com/eclipse/jnosql-databases[GitHub repository].

=== Configuring project dependencies

Let's use MongoDB as the default document database. Add the following Maven dependency into the `pom.xml` file of the project:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jnosql.databases</groupId>
  <artifactId>jnosql-mongodb</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Once you add the appropriate dependency, you need to configure the credentials for your document database. These credentials typically include details such as the database name, host, port, and any required authentication credentials. To configure MongoDB, you can find the supported credentials properties at the https://github.com/eclipse/jnosql-databases#mongodb[Eclipse JNoSQL MongoDB Database API Configuration].

=== Setting up local NoSQL databases

Installing and managing databases locally requires additional efforts that we will not cover it in this blog post. We chose to use Docker Compose as the tooling for managing containers locally. Take a look at the https://docs.docker.com/compose/[Docker Compose Overview] to learn more about this tool.

Let's create a `docker-compose.yml` file into the project root directory and add the following content:

[source, yaml]
----
services:

  mongo:
    image: mongo
    restart: always
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    ports:
      - 27017:27017

  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express:1.0.0-alpha
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
    environment:
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME: root
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD: example
      ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_URL: mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/
----

For convenience, the previous example added a `mongo-express` service that allows us to navigate and manage MongoDB data through a friendly web interface.

NOTE: Feel free to customize the declaration of the containers in the `docker-compose.yml` file. For example, the database data is saved inside the container image, which means that the data will be lost if the containers are deleted.

Now, to start up the databases we just need to run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

You should now be able to access the mongo-express UI at http://localhost:8081/ :

[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/mongo-express.png[Mongo Express, align="center" width=80%]


=== Defining database credentials

Now that we defined the MongoDB database instance, we can set up the Eclipse JNoSQL framework correctly.

Eclipse JNoSQL uses link:https://microprofile.io/specifications/microprofile-config/[MicroProfile Config] to get the required configurations to establish the connection to the databases. We can define these properties in the `resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties` file by using environment variables. For more information about MicroProfile Config, take a look at its link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/external-configuration.html/[External configuration of microservices].

According to the `docker-compose.yml` file that we have created previously, we can define the following properties:

[source, properties]
----
jnosql.mongodb.host=localhost:27017
jnosql.mongodb.user=root
jnosql.mongodb.password=example
jnosql.mongodb.authentication.source=admin
----

=== Modeling data with Jakarta NoSQL

Once we add the Eclipse JNoSQL dependencies, the Jakarta NoSQL api comes together as a transient dependency to the project, allowing us to create the NoSQL entities we want.

Let's model the `GameMatch` entity, which represents each game match result.

As we said before, Eclipse JNoSQL allows us to use Java Records as entities, so, let's use this feature:

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.model;

import jakarta.nosql.Column;
import jakarta.nosql.Entity;
import jakarta.nosql.Id;

@Entity
public record GameMatch (
        @Id
        String id,

        @Column
        PlayerInfo playerA,

        @Column
        PlayerInfo playerB,

        @Column
        PlayerInfo winner,

        @Column
        PlayerInfo loser,

        @Column
        Boolean tied
){
}
----

To represent each player name and movement, let's model such data as a `PlayerInfo` record class:

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.model;

import jakarta.nosql.Column;
import jakarta.nosql.Entity;

@Entity
public record PlayerInfo (

        @Column
        String name,

        @Column
        String movement
){
}

----

=== Data store and retrieval with Jakarta Data

Now, we'll create a component to store and retrieve such entities from the MongoDB database. It's common to see developers using patterns like data access object (DAO) to implement these components. That's not a problem at all, but we use to see them making the components closer to a specific vendor database semantics, raising a vendor lock-in situation.

Nowadays, in the cloud era where we pay as we go, switching between NoSQL solutions can save resources and costs. But vendor lock-in would probably compromise this strategy. Also, other considerations come to the table when there's a need to switch databases, such as time spent on the change, the learning curve of a new API, the code that will be lost, the persistence layer that needs to be replaced, etc. This is where the flexibility of Jakarta NoSQL shines.

Another interesting point is that DAO components tend to be closer to the database semantics than the business domain model language, requiring a high cognitive load for developers to connect the dots and fill the gaps between the technical codes and business necessities, once the code is not expressive enough, and doesn't fit with the ubiquitous language of the business. At this point, Jakarta Data comes into play!

Coming back to our challenge, let's create a repository component that will represents the play-offs:

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.model;

import jakarta.data.repository.DataRepository;
import jakarta.data.repository.Query;
import jakarta.data.repository.Repository;
import jakarta.data.repository.Save;

@Repository
public interface Playoffs extends DataRepository<GameMatch,String> {

    @Save
    GameMatch add(GameMatch gameMatch);

}
----

=== Capturing and persisting game matches

With the entity and repository already created, we need to capture and persist the results of each game match. The next obvious question is: how could we capture the required game events?

It's a really good question! The answer is: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0#events[the Events API provided by the Jakarta Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) specification]!

JNopo game uses link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/4.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-4.0#events[CDI Events] to promote extension points, based on event publishing, to be used as needed. With that, we can implement an `@Observable` methods on any CDI bean to handle event objects.

See the following `GameState` interface. Objects that implement this interface will act as event objects:

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.game;

public sealed interface GameState permits
        WaitingPlayers,
        GameInvalid,
        GameAbandoned,
        GameReady,
        GameRunning,
        GameOver {
    String gameId();
}
----

The `GameState` interface is a sealed interface that defines all the supported game states. According to the sealed implementation, the event that we're interested is the `GameOver` state. Such class is a record class. But it's not just a simple record class that acts like a data transfer object (DTO), it has useful methods that return important info like:

* The game identification
* A tied attribute, to know whether the game ended as a tied
* Player A and its moves
* Player B and its moves
* The winning player and its moves, if the game ended without a tied.
* The losing player and its moves, if the game ended without a tied.

Now let`s create the `GameMatchCapturer` bean that captures the emitted `GameOver` state and stores the game match results in the database:

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.model;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.enterprise.event.Observes;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import org.jakartaee.sample.game.GameOver;

@ApplicationScoped
public class GameMatchCapturer {

    public void captureAndPersist(@Observes GameOver gameOver){
        // put the persistence logic here...
    }

}

----

At this point, let's instantiate a new `GameMatch` entity instance, populate it from `GameOver` data and then store it into the database by using the `Playoffs` component.

The required `Playoff` component, which is a repository implementation provided Eclipse JNoSQL, will be injected by CDI using the `@Inject` and `@Database(DOCUMENT)` annotations:

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.model;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.enterprise.event.Observes;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.jnosql.mapping.Database;
import org.eclipse.jnosql.mapping.DatabaseType;
import org.jakartaee.sample.game.GameOver;

@ApplicationScoped
public class GameMatchCapturer {

    @Inject
    @Database(DatabaseType.DOCUMENT)
    Playoffs playoffs;

    public void captureAndPersist(@Observes GameOver gameOver){

            var gameMatch  = new GameMatch(
                    gameOver.gameId(),
                    PlayerInfo.of(gameOver.playerAInfo()),
                    PlayerInfo.of(gameOver.playerBInfo()),
                    gameOver.winnerInfo().map(PlayerInfo::of).orElse(PlayerInfo.NOBODY),
                    gameOver.winnerInfo().map(PlayerInfo::of).orElse(PlayerInfo.NOBODY),
                    gameOver.isTied()
            );

            playoffs.add(gameMatch);
    }

}
----

Now, let's start the Open Liberty runtime to figure out if the game match results are being stored on the MongoDB.

* On Linux/Mac machines, run the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
./mvnw liberty:dev
----

* On Windows machines, run the following command:
+
[source, powershell]
----
mvnw.cmd liberty:dev
----

After some game matches, we can confirm the persistence of the game matches into the database by looking at Mongo Express running on http://localhost:8081 :

[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/mongo-express-01.png[Mongo Express 01, align="center" width=80%]

[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/mongo-express-02.png[Mongo Express 02, align="center" width=80%]

[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/mongo-express-03.png[Mongo Express 03, align="center" width=80%]

[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/mongo-express-04.png[Mongo Express 04, align="center" width=80%]

Or, if you're a command-line practitioner, you can check the data by using the `mongosh` cli:

[source, bash]
----
docker exec -it finish-mongo-1 mongosh -u root -p example --authenticationDatabase admin jnopo
----

Once connected, you can run `mongo` commands:

* Getting the number of stored documents:
+
[source, bash]
----
jnopo> db.GameMatch.countDocuments()
3
----

* Getting the stored documents list:
+
[source, bash]
----
jnopo> db.GameMatch.find()
[
  {
    _id: '2f42cf9e-f99c-44e5-bda8-7707da2579a3',
    tied: true,
    winner: { name: '', movement: '' },
    playerA: { name: 'Max', movement: 'ROCK' },
    playerB: { name: 'Ghost', movement: 'ROCK' },
    loser: { name: '', movement: '' }
  },
  {
    _id: 'c425815c-2aaf-4caa-a975-8e8089f0a0ce',
    tied: false,
    winner: { name: 'Max', movement: 'PAPER' },
    playerA: { name: 'Ghost', movement: 'ROCK' },
    playerB: { name: 'Max', movement: 'PAPER' },
    loser: { name: 'Max', movement: 'PAPER' }
  },
  {
    _id: 'bb7e7cd5-f8fe-4db1-9e90-44ecd433b4de',
    tied: false,
    winner: { name: 'Ghost', movement: 'ROCK' },
    playerA: { name: 'Ghost', movement: 'ROCK' },
    playerB: { name: 'Max', movement: 'SCISSORS' },
    loser: { name: 'Ghost', movement: 'ROCK' }
  }
]
----

Great! JNopo is storing the game match results as expected! It's time to create the winner ranking and then expose it though a restful endpoint: http://localhost:9080/jakarta-nosql-game/api/playoffs/ranking .

==== Exposing the Winner Ranking

Collecting and storing the game matches results is a great step to make us able to implement the winner ranking feature.

Let's implement the `Ranking` class to represent any ranking on the *JNopo* application.

The `Ranking` creation requires the data from the `Playoffs` component. In order to avoid to create a new layer to keep the logic of the ranking creation, I decided to use a simple approach: a simple static factory method on the `Ranking` class itself.

Firstly, `Playoffs` needs to provide a method to retrieve the non-tied game results:

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.model;

import jakarta.data.repository.DataRepository;
import jakarta.data.repository.Query;
import jakarta.data.repository.Repository;
import jakarta.data.repository.Save;

import java.util.stream.Stream;

@Repository
public interface Playoffs extends DataRepository<GameMatch,String> {

    @Save
    GameMatch add(GameMatch gameMatch);

    @Query("select * from GameMatch where tied=false")
    Stream<GameMatch> nonTiedGameMatches();

}
----

NOTE: *JNoSQL* offers a simple query language pretty similar to SQL but be sure that it's not a complete SQL implementation, which means, some aggregation and functions will be not available.

Regarding the aggregation process that evolves the ranking logic creation, we use to see developers delegating this aggregation logic to the DBMS and, depending on the persistence mechanism, it should be the best approach. By now, the grouping projection functions like we have with Jakarta Persistence is not available on the Jakarta NoSQL for now, but, in the future, such capability could be available as well.

In order to keep our implementation free of vendor lock-in, I decided to implement the aggregation process by using the Stream API. I added comments on the code to help you to understand the implemented logic.

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.model;

import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public record Ranking(Map<String, Integer> data) {
    public static Ranking winnerRanking(Playoffs playoffs) {

        var data =
                // getting the game matches that are not tied
                playoffs.nonTiedGameMatches()
                // grouping by winner's name and summarize by game match
                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(
                        g -> g.winner().name(),
                        Collectors.collectingAndThen(Collectors.toList(), Collection::size)))
                .entrySet()
                .stream()
                // sorting the results by number of game match in descending order
                .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue(Comparator.reverseOrder()))
                // collecting as a LinkedHashMap to keep the sorted items
                .collect(Collectors.toMap(
                        Map.Entry::getKey,
                        Map.Entry::getValue,
                        (e1, e2) -> e1, LinkedHashMap::new));

        return new Ranking(data);
    }
}
----

Now, let make this ranking be accessible by our model. As the ranking needs the data from `Playoffs` component, why not to put this ranking creation on the `Playoffs` interface? That's we're going to do! It is possible since the Java 8:

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.model;

import jakarta.data.repository.DataRepository;
import jakarta.data.repository.Query;
import jakarta.data.repository.Repository;
import jakarta.data.repository.Save;

import java.util.stream.Stream;

@Repository
public interface Playoffs extends DataRepository<GameMatch,String> {

    @Save
    GameMatch add(GameMatch gameMatch);

    @Query("select * from GameMatch where tied=false")
    Stream<GameMatch> nonTiedGameMatches();

    default Ranking winnerRanking(){
       return Ranking.winnerRanking(this);
    }
}
----

It looks like we're getting closer to our goal!

Following the challenge requirements, let's create the resource component that will expose the winner ranking.

Firstly, let's create the `RestApplication` class to define the url dedicated to restful endpoints:
[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.resources;

import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/api")
public class RestApplication extends Application {

}
----

Now, any url under `/api` will be handled by the Jakarta Restful Webservices implementation available in our runtime environment.

Next step: let's implement the `PlayoffsResource` resource. This component will expose an HTTP GET endpoint for the `/api/playoffs/ranking` url:

[source, java]
----
package org.jakartaee.sample.resources;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Consumes;
import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import org.eclipse.jnosql.mapping.Database;
import org.eclipse.jnosql.mapping.DatabaseType;
import org.jakartaee.sample.model.Playoffs;
import org.jakartaee.sample.model.Ranking;

@Path("/playoffs")
@Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON})
@Produces({MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON})
public class PlayoffsResource {

    @Inject
    @Database(DatabaseType.DOCUMENT)
    Playoffs playoffs;

    @GET
    @Path("/ranking")
    public Ranking getRanking() {
        return playoffs.winnerRanking();
    }
}
----

It's time to test everything! Let's restart the https://openliberty.io/[Open Liberty] runtime:

* On Linux/Mac machines, perform the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
./mvnw liberty:dev
----

* On Windows machines, perform the following command:
+
[source, powershell]
----
mvnw.cmd liberty:dev
----

https://openliberty.io/[Open Liberty]  provides us an amazing tooling to help during the development of Jakarta EE / MicroProfile applications. When the dev mode is running, we can use some HTTP addresses to test and explore the capabilities offered by this amazing Jakarta EE/MicroProfile runtime:

== Key Takeaways

This challenge was an amazing opportunity to learn not just about Jakarta NoSQL and Jakarta Data to simplify the NoSQL integration with Java applications but also to explore new development approaches using interesting Java features.

What we got by doing these challenges:

* A practical example that uses:
** Sealed classes (final feature since Java 17)
** Pattern Matching for Instanceof (final feature since Java 16)
** Pattern Matching for Switch (final feature since Java 21)

What we learned from them:

* How to configure Eclipse JNoSQL to allow us to work with Jakarta NoSQL and Jakarta Data in a Jakarta EE / MicroProfile project
* How to work with Jakarta NoSQL to create entities pretty similar to Jakarta Persistence approach
* How to create repositories with Jakarta Data, the newest Jakarta EE Specification that will be available in the Jakarta EE 11

== Next steps: continuing the journey

Congratulations on getting this far!

In the next blog post, a new challenge is introduced: *Switching NoSQL Databases with Ease*! Stay tuned!
