= Dev mode with container support in Liberty Maven and Gradle Plug-ins

In this blog post, we announce the releases of Liberty Maven Plug-in 3.3.1 and Liberty Gradle Plug-in 3.1.  These releases include the general availability of container support in dev mode, support for copying dependencies, and a number of other fixes.

== Dev mode with containers

If you are developing an application locally in a container, you can minimize differences between your development and production environments by running your containerized server in dev mode. With container support for dev mode, you can use the same Dockerfile for both development and production. You use the same base image and customizations, and specify the same configuration files in your Dockerfile that you use for your application in production.

In dev mode, your code changes are automatically hot deployed to the container and picked up by the running server. Additionally, dev mode allows you to run tests either automatically or on demand, and you can attach a debugger at any time to debug your application which is running in the container.

Container support in dev mode was previously available as a tech preview and is now generally available to use.  Check out our previous link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/08/25/dev-mode-containers-preview.html[blog post] to find out more about how this feature lets you iterate quickly in developing your containerized application.

For more information on using this feature, see link:/docs/20.0.0.12/development-mode.html#_container_support_for_dev_mode[Container support for dev mode] in the Open Liberty docs.

== Copying dependencies

In addition to including many fixes, this release of the Liberty Maven plug-in provides support for copying dependencies during server creation with the `copyDependencies` parameter.

If a dependency is not listed in the Maven `dependencies` section of the pom.xml, then the full group, artifact, and version coordinates will need to be specified in the `copyDependencies` configuration. Alternatively, you can copy all resolved dependencies matching a specific groupId, or a specific groupId and artifactId. The artifactId may also end with a `*` to match all artifacts that have an artifactId that start with the specified string. Transitive dependencies are also copied. Additionally, a `stripVersion` parameter is available to strip the version during the copy.

See the new `copyDependencies` parameter in the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/master/docs/common-server-parameters.md#common-server-parameters[common server parameters] of the Liberty Maven Plug-in for more details on the configuration.

== Using the plug-ins

For Maven projects, specify the latest version of the Liberty Maven plug-in in your project `pom.xml` file:
[source,xml]
----
    <plugin>
        <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.3.1</version>
    </plugin>
----

For Gradle projects, specify the latest version of the Liberty Gradle plug-in in your project `build.gradle` file:
[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'liberty'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.1'
    }
}
----

Then run one of the Liberty link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven#goals[Maven goals] or link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle#tasks[Gradle tasks] to get started!
