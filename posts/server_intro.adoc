= The purpose of application servers
Yasmin Aumeeruddy <https://github.com/yasmin-aumeeruddy>

I have set myself a challenge to help the next generation of developers understand the purpose of an application server at a high level. The question to be answered is __"Why do we need application servers, such as Open Liberty?"__.

It will be obvious to most that a website is a collection of webpages that consist of `HTML` documents to provide content and `CSS` to provide design elements. These are stored and hosted on servers which are computers that provide functionality for clients. On the other hand, a client is a user’s device connected to the internet, for example, through a web browser or mobile application. They can request and receive web pages from that server. This process describes how to access a static website that can be served on a web server, but a dynamic website requires server-side programming, e.g. Java or Python. This is where application servers come in as the runtime environment allows for logic to be updated and accessed dynamically. 

As developers, we tend to forget that many users are unfamiliar with how websites are accessed. The first thing to be aware of is that an *IP*(Internet Protocol) address is assigned to every device on a network, but end users are more familiar with domain names that are linked to them. To locate a desired web page, they would typically use a *URL* (Uniform Resource Locator) which can be translated to get the *IP* address, web page and protocol. *HTTP* is a request-response protocol that uses methods such as *POST* and *GET* so a client can successfully communicate with a server.

An application server is software containing two main components: a web container to handle requests and another container to handle business logic. Open Liberty is a Java runtime and therefore, contains an Enterprise Java Bean (*EJB*) container. This logic can be retrieved from an external database server and updated by components within the EJB container before sending it to the web container and client over HTTP.

The following steps outline how a user receives a list of books from a library: 

. John uses his PC to search for a book at *\http://www.library.com/books/search*
. A HTTP request is sent to the application server. A HTTP GET method is used here and the data is sent through “parameters” in the URL: *\http://www.library.com/books/search?bookName=open+liberty*
. A Java class in the EJB container uses the database server to locate the book that is provided by the parameters in the URL.
. The required data about the book is returned to the web container. 
. A HTTP response is sent to the web client, showing the formatted data about the book on their browser for John to see. 

If it wasn’t for the use of an application server, John would not have been able to just see the book he desired and the relevant information about it. The data is therefore dynamic because he would receive different information depending on what he had searched for. Therefore, this scenario would not be possible with a static site and instead, all of the books would have had to be hardcoded into the page for John to browse.  

Application servers like Open Liberty enable developers to write dynamic websites which can, for example, access databases that are updated independently of the website itself. Try out Open Liberty now with the link:/guides/getting-started.html[Getting Started] guide.
