== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A24005+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 24.0.0.5].


* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/28152[FeatureUtility custom repository connection issue]
+
In some scenarios, the `FeatureUtility` connection test to custom repo (base url) returns a 400 response code  and fails to recognize it as working repository. It's not good to fail fast because there are cases where users do not have appropriate access to the whole repository, but they have access to certain artifacts in the repository. In such cases, response code can return 400, 403, etc.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/28125[Incompatibility reported between sipServlet-1.1 and WebSockets]
+
A ClassCastException exception occurs with `sipServlet-1.1` and a WebSocket feature.
+
`java.lang.ClassCastException: com.ibm.wsspi.sip.converge.ConvergedHttpSessionContextImpl incompatible with com.ibm.ws.webcontainer31.session.IHttpSessionContext31 com.ibm.ws.wsoc.WebSocketServletContainerInitialize`

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/28101[FeatureUtility prints warning when user repositories doesn't have authentication]
+
When users specify Maven repositories without authentication, the `featureUtility` command prints the following warning in verbose mode.
`CWWKF1374E: The password is not encrypted. Password must be encrypted using the securityUtility command with the AES cryptography algorithm as the recommended --encoding option.`
