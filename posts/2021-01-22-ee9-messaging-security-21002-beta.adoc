New in Open Liberty 21.0.0.2-beta are four Jakarta EE 9 packages, Jakarta Messaging 3.0, Jakarta Security 2.0, Jakarta Batch 2.0, and Jakarta XML Web Services 3.0, that join the large stable of Jakarta EE 9 packages already available within Open Liberty. Open Liberty 21.0.0.2-beta also includes previews for 7 of the updated MicroProfile features, including Config, Metrics, OpenTracing, Health, OpenAPI, Rest Client, and JWT. 

We have two beta packages for link:{url-about}[Open Liberty]:

* <<jakarta, Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features>>: a lightweight package that contains only the Jakarta EE 9 features.
* <<allbeta, All Beta Features>>: a larger package that contains all Open Liberty beta features (including Jakarta EE 9 beta features) and GA features and functions.

This means that you can now try out our in-development Open Liberty features by just adding the relevant coordinates to your build tools.

If you try either package, <<feedback, let us know what you think>>.

[#jakarta]
== Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package

The main change visible to developers in Jakarta EE is the names of packages changing to accomodate the new `jakarta.*` namespace. In this Open Liberty beta, we have a number of new API Release Candidates to join the expanding library of supported Jakarta packages.

This Open Liberty beta introduces the following Jakarta EE 9 features which now possess their all-new Jakarta EE 9 package names:

* <<messaging, Jakarta Messaging 3.0 (`messaging-3.0, messagingClient-3.0, messagingServer-3.0, messagingSecurity-3.0`)>>
* <<security, Jakarta Security 2.0 (`appSecurity-4.0, appSecurityClient-1.0`)>>
* Jakarta Batch 2.0 (`batch-2.0`)
* Jakarta XML Web Services 3.0 (`xmlWS-3.0`)

These join the Jakarta EE 9 features in link:https://openliberty.io/blog/?search=beta&key=tag[previous Open Liberty betas]:

[#messaging]
=== Messaging 3.0

Jakarta Messaging is an API and services that enable applications to create, send, and receive messages via loosely coupled, reliable asynchronous communications. Support for version 3.0 updates the API and services to the jakarta.* namespace and introduces four new features for Jakarta EE 9: `messaging-3.0`, `messagingClient-3.0`, `messagingServer-3.0`, `messagingSecurity-3.0`.

Configuration is the same as the corresponding features for Jakarta EE 8 (`jms-2.0`, `wasJmsClient-2.0`, `wasJmsServer-1.0`, `wasJmsSecurity-1.0`) with one exception: version 3.0 support does not introduce a new feature corresponding to `jmsMdb-1.0`. Instead, use Jakarta EE 9 feature `mdb-4.0` when deploying message-driven beans to connect to MQ providers, Jakarta Connectors resource adapters, or the embedded messaging server.

To enable the new Jakarta EE 9 messaging features, add them to your `server.xml`. Here's a feature configuration that enables applications to access message queues via the Messaging 3.0 API, enables message-driven beans to connect to the embedded messaging server, and enables JNDI lookups for messaging resources.

The following features can be included in your server.xml:

[source, xml]
----
 <featureManager>
       <feature>messagingClient-3.0</feature>
       <feature>mdb-4.0</feature>
       <feature>jndi-1.0</feature>
 </featureManager>
----

Jakarta Messaging 3.0 was originally included in the Open Liberty link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/11/24/microprofile-rest-client-kubernetes-secrets-21001beta.html[21.0.0.1-beta], but missed publication.

Additional information about the Jakarta Messaging 3.0 specification can be found link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/messaging/3.0/[here].

[#security]
=== Security 2.0

The new `appSecurity-4.0` feature has been created to support Jakarta EE 9 and introduces Jakarta Security 2.0 support. The `appSecurityClient-1.0`, `audit-1.0`, `constrainedDelegation-1.0`, `jcaInboundSecurity-1.0`, `jwt-1.0`, `passwordUtilities-1.0` and `spnego-1.0` features have been updated to also support Jakarta EE 9.

The `appSecurity-4.0` feature must be added to `server.xml` when using application security with Jakarta EE 9. The other `security-2.0` feature will automatically adapt to the level of Java EE or Jakarta EE that is already in use, so no change is needed when using them with Jakarta EE 9.

The following features can be included in your server.xml:

[source, xml]
----
 <featureManager>
       <feature>appSecurity-4.0</feature>
       <feature>appSecurityClient-1.0</feature>
       <feature>audit-1.0</feature>
       <feature>constrainedDelegation-1.0</feature>
       <feature>jcaInboundSecurity-1.0</feature>
       <feature>jwt-1.0</feature>
       <feature>passwordUtilities-1.0</feature>
       <feature>spnego-1.0</feature>
 </featureManager>
----

Additional information about the Jakarta Security 2.0 specification can be found link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/2.0/[here].

Enable the Jakarta EE 9 beta features in your app's `server.xml`. You can enable the individual features you want or you can just add the Jakarta EE 9 convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 9 beta features at once:

[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jakartaee-9.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

Or you can add the Web Profile convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile beta features at once:

[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>webProfile-9.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

=== Try it now

To try out these Jakarta EE 9 features on Open Liberty in a lightweight package, just update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 15, Java SE 11, or Java SE 8.

If you're using link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven], here are the coordinates:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.beta</groupId>
    <artifactId>openliberty-jakartaee9</artifactId>
    <version>21.0.0.2-beta</version>

[#allbeta]
== All Beta Features package

The All Beta Features package includes the following beta features (in addition to all Jakarta EE 9 beta features):

* link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/11/24/microprofile-rest-client-kubernetes-secrets-21001beta.html#kube[Using Kubernetes secrets in Liberty variables]

Currently, due to an link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/15649[issue in MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 3.0], neither the `mpFaultTolerance-3.0` feature nor the `microProfile-4.0` convenience feature can be used in the Open Liberty 21.0.0.2-beta. All other MicroProfile 4.0 features can still be individually installed.

=== Try it now 

To try out these features, just update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty All Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 15, Java SE 11, or Java SE 8.
