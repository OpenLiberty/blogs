= Automatically generate features in your Open Liberty server configuration (technology preview)

In this post, we introduce a technology preview for automatically generating a list of features as part of your project's Open Liberty server configuration. When you run Open liberty in https://www.openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode], features are now automatically generated in your server configuration as you develop your cloud-native Java application.

Dev mode monitors the class files in your application and detects when they use new Open Liberty feature APIs. If dev mode detects features that are not already specified in your server configuration, a new `generated-features.xml` file is created in your `configDropins/overrides` directory.  This function simplifies your developer workflow because you no longer need to manually specify these features. We recommend that you commit this new `generated-features.xml` file to your version control.
User-specified features always take precedence over automatically generated features. Automatically generated features will not replace or conflict with features that you have already manually specified in your `server.xml`.

This function is enabled by default in the `3.6` of the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven[Liberty Maven Plugin] and the `3.4` of the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle[Liberty Gradle Plugin]. We invite you to try it out and let us know your thoughts so that we can make it even more useful for your development scenarios.

== Dev mode with automatic generation of features

For Maven projects, specify the Liberty Maven Plugin with version `3.6` and its Sonatype repository in your `pom.xml` file:
[source,xml]
----
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>sonatype</id>
            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>

<plugin>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.6</version>
</plugin>
----

For Gradle projects, specify the Liberty Gradle Plugin with version `3.4` and its Sonatype repository in your `build.gradle` file:
[source, groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'liberty'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2"
            url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.4'
    }
}
----

Start dev mode by running the following Maven goal or Gradle task. Automatic feature generation is enabled by default in the previously mentioned Maven and Gradle snapshot releases for this technology preview.

* Maven: `mvn liberty:dev`
* Gradle: `gradle libertyDev`

As you make code changes to your application, dev mode monitors API use in your class files and automatically generates and installs new Open Liberty features as needed.

The feature list is generated in a new `configDropins/overrides/generated-features.xml` file in your project server configuration directory.

.Example generated-features.xml
[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<server>
    <!--This file was generated by the Liberty Maven Plugin and will be overwritten on subsequent runs of the liberty:generate-features goal.
 It is recommended that you do not edit this file and that you commit this file to your version control.-->
    <featureManager>
        <!--The following features were generated based on API usage detected in your application-->
        <feature>cdi-2.0</feature>
        <feature>mpHealth-3.0</feature>
        <feature>mpMetrics-3.0</feature>
        <feature>jaxrs-2.1</feature>
    </featureManager>
</server>
----

As you make changes to your application, dev mode scans for API use only in class files that you have just modified. However, you might run into a scenario where a feature has been generated that is no longer used in any of your classes. You can have dev mode re-scan all class files in your application and generate an optimized list of features by typing 'o' and pressing Enter in the dev mode terminal.

=== Disabling automatic generation of features in dev mode

To disable automatic feature generation, you can set the `generateFeatures` parameter to false by running the following Maven goal or Gradle task.

* Maven: `mvn liberty:dev -DgenerateFeatures=false`
* Gradle: `gradle libertyDev --generateFeatures=false`

You can toggle automatic feature generation on and off by typing 'g' and pressing Enter in the dev mode terminal.

=== Dev mode help menu

This latest snapshot release also includes a new help menu view in dev mode. By typing 'h' and pressing Enter in the dev mode terminal, you can see a list of hotkeys and actions that you can perform in dev mode.

=== Automatically generating features outside of dev mode

To generate a server configuration feature list for your application outside of dev mode, compile your project and run the new generate features stand-alone goal or task. You must run the "installFeatures" goal or task afterwards to install the features that are generated.

* Maven: `mvn compile liberty:generate-features`
* Gradle: `mvn compileJava generateFeatures`

=== Additional resources

To try out automatic generation of features on a demo project, see the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/demo-devmode/tree/generate-features[generate-features branch of the demo-devmode project].

For more information, see the official documentation for the `liberty:generate-features` goal of the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/blob/main/docs/generate-features.md[Liberty Maven Plugin] or the `generateFeatures` task of the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.gradle/blob/main/docs/generateFeatures.md[Liberty Gradle Plugin].
