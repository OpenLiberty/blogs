[#kerberos]
=== Kerberos authentication for JDBC data sources

Kerberos is a network authentication protocol in which a client and server authenticate by communicating with a Key Distribution Center (KDC). Kerberos authentication may be used for JDBC data sources that are backed by one of the following databases:

* IBM DB2
* Oracle Database
* Microsoft SQLServer
* PostgreSQL

Kerberos authentication in Liberty builds on top of the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/jdk.security.auth/com/sun/security/auth/module/Krb5LoginModule.html[Kerberos Login Module and JGSS API] provided by the JDK, which in turn builds on top of the Kerberos OS libraries for the specific system being used.

The `kerberos` configuration element in `server.xml` provides system-wide configuration options for the Liberty server. For example:

[source, xml]
----
  <kerberos keytab="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.keytab" configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>
----

Below is an example of the Kerberos protocol being used to secure a data source: 

[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
  </featureManager>

  <!-- optional config: This is only needed if you need to customize the location of keytab or krb5.conf -->
  <kerberos keytab="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.keytab" configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>

  <authData id="myKerberosAuth" krb5Principal="krbUser"/>

  <library id="db2DriverLib">
    <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/db2"/>
  </library>

  <dataSource jndiName="jdbc/krb/basic" containerAuthDataRef="myKerberosAuth">
    <jdbcDriver libraryRef="db2DriverLib"/>
    <properties.db2.jcc databaseName="${DB2_DBNAME}" serverName="${DB2_HOSTNAME}" portNumber="${DB2_PORT}"/>
  </dataSource>
----

Before this release, it was technically possible to use Kerberos authentication with JDBC data sources, but the configuration was complex and un-documented. There was also previously a lack of connection pooling support when using Kerberos authentication for data sources.

Full documentation for this capability will be available soon in the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/overview.html[Open Liberty documentation] pages.

[#grafana]
== Grafana dashboard support for Thanos data source

With Open Liberty 20.0.0.11 the Open Liberty Grafana dashboard, which visualizes data from the MicroProfile Metrics feature, is now able to visualize data from a Thanos data source.

The Grafana dashboard provides a wide range of time-series visualizations of MicroProfile Metrics data such as CPU, Servlet, Connection Pool, and Garbage Collection metrics. It is powered by a Prometheus data source which is configured to ingest data from the `/metrics` endpoint of one or more Liberty servers, enabling you to view performance metrics in near real-time.

Previously, support has only been provided for visualizing metrics data with Grafana on Open Liberty servers that used Prometheus as the data source. In Kubernetes environments, such as the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can use Thanos to query and store metrics data from multiple clusters. The previous Grafana Dashboards would not work when Thanos was set as the data source, whereas the new Grafana dashboard allows users using Thanos as the data source to display metrics data.

[#bugs]
== Significant bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3ARELEASE_VERSION+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 20.0.0.11].

. link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14377[Server.xml config sources would not respect the "config_ordinal" property]
+
The MicroProfile Config specification allows for the ordinal of a built in config source to be changed by link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-config-1.4/microprofile-config-spec.html#_manually_defining_the_ordinal_of_a_built_in_configsource[defining a property] named `config_ordinal` which is read from that config source.
+
However, built in config sources for `server.xml` variables and `<appProperties>` would not change their ordinal if a property with `config_ordinal` is set.
+
This has now been corrected and built-in config sources will now update their ordinal when `config_ordinal` is set. 

. link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/14192[Wrong month returned when OffsetDateTime is used via EclipseLink 2.7]
+
Previously a flaw existed within link:https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/documentation/2.7/[EclipseLink]'s implementation regarding converting certain link:https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/persistence-2_2-mrel-spec/JavaPersistence.pdf[java.time] types. Mismatched constant values utilised by the built-in conversion would result in an incorrect and invalid month being chosen for the conversion.
+
This behaviour has now been corrected for Open Liberty 20.0.0.11 and `OffsetDateTime` should now return a correct value consistently.

. link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/12724[Unable to Override JAX-RS SecurityContext in ContainerRequestFilter]
+
Previously, overriding the default SecurityContext in a JAX-RS authorisation filter using `ContainerRequestFilter.setSecurityContext()` would not affect the SecurityContext used by OpenLiberty during authorisation.
+
This has now been corrected by updating JAX-RS 2.0 and 2.1 to always process `javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext` if it exists, and in the event that it does not to fall back onto `org.apache.cxf.security.SecurityContext`.

. link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/13908[Open Liberty Java security function did not grant default permissions from the JDK's "java.policy" file to applications]
+
Included with any JDK is a `java.policy` file that allows Java code to access various system specific actions, for example the ability to read system properties (i.e. `os.name`).
+
Open Liberty would previously return an `AccessControlException` when attempting to use the `System.getProperty()` method to read the system properties that were permitted to be read.  This behavior required application developers to grant these permissions in their applications' permissions.xml file or in the server.xml unnecessarily.
+
This has now been fixed by ensuring that all of the `java.policy` permissions are imported into all code sources.

. link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/7056[HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 behave differently when using a non-standard HTTP method]
+
Since release 18.0.0.2 Open Liberty has included full HTTP/2 support via Servlet 4.0.
+
In the past OpenLiberty versions the HTTP `PATCH` method, or any non-standard HTTP method, would return a `HTTP 501 Not Implemented` error when using HTTP/2.
+
This has now been updated to allow the `PATCH` and other non-standard HTTP methods to be used with both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 inside Open Liberty 20.0.0.11.
