//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
// Do not remove or edit the variables on the lines beneath the author name.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to
// a custom picture, you must provide a custom string for "open-graph-image-alt".
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title eg: MicroProfile 3.3 is now available on Open Liberty 20.0.0.4
// Replace ramkumar-k-9286 with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
// Replace Ramkumar K with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-04-09-microprofile-3-3-open-liberty-20004.adoc
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark
// backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

RELEASE_SUMMARY

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Leave any instances of `tag::xxxx[]` or `end:xxxx[]` as they are.
//
// Replace RELEASE_SUMMARY with a short paragraph that summarises the release. Start with the lead feature but also summarise what else is new in the release. You will agree which will be the lead feature with the reviewers so you can just leave a placeholder here until after the initial review.

// // // // // // // //
// Replace the following throughout the document:
//   Replace 24.0.0.4 with the version number of Open Liberty, eg: 22.0.0.2

Java 22 is the latest release of Java, released in March 2024. It contains new features and enhancements over previous versions of Java. However, Java 22 is not a long-term support (LTS) release and support for it will be dropped when the next version of Java is supported. It offers some new functions and changes that you are going to want to see for yourself.

[#bugs]
== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A24004+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 24.0.0.4].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/28083[Server Won't Start with Space in File Path]
+
If there is a space in the file path of a server's log directory, there will be an error with the verbose garbage collection option that will keep the server from starting. Trying to start the server via a terminal gives the message `Server defaultServer start failed. Check server logs for details.`
+
Console.log contains:
```
JVMJ9VM007E Command-line option unrecognised: Files\IBM\WebSphere\Liberty\usr\servers\defaultServer\logs\verbosegc.%seq.log,10,1024
```
+
The full file path for the verbosegc option in this case was `C:\\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere\Liberty\usr\servers\defaultServer\logs\verbosegc.%seq.log,10,1024`. The space in `Program Files` causes the option to get split and then causes an error.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/28044[IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty is vulnerable to a denial of service due to jose4j (CVE-2023-51775)]
+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/28012[IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (CVE-2024-27270)]
+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/27971[WLP_INSTALL_DIR set incorrectly when wlp/bin is a symbolic link]
+
This is an edge case where the the wlp/**bin** directory is a symbolic link.  In this case, WLP_INSTALL_DIR might resolve to the parent of the **symbolic link** (logical path) rather than the real path (physical path) of the wlp directory.   It works fine if there is a symbolic link somewhere in the ancestry of the bin directory, but fails in some cases when bin is a symbolic link. 
+
The problem is that we first append "/.." to the **bin**  directory, before trying to resolve the path.   At that point, we are now trying to resolve the <ins>parent</ins> of the symbolic link, which normally won't resolve to anything different unless the parent or another ancestor directory is also a symbolic link.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/27900[NullPointerException may occur for HTTPs requests to WebContainer]
+
If secured request (i.e https:// ) is accepted into the WebContainer but has an exception before the WebContainer can determine a target application to handle this request, the java.lang.NullPointerException can occur. 
+
Same scenario does not have NPE using the un-secure (i.e http) request.

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/27886[NullPointerException can occur in Kernel ClassLoader]
+
NullPointerException is possible in Kernel Classloader

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/27833[JAX-rs and RestfulWS monitor bundles' filters are still creating objects when REST is filtered out of monitor-1.0]
+
When using `monitor-1.0` with `jaxrs-*` and the `monitor-1.0`'s filter attribute has filtered out the REST stat module, REST stat objects are still created, but are discarded and will be garbage collected. However, during high loads this can increase the memory consumption as it may take awhile for GC to occur.

+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/27620[Invalid encoded request URI should return 400 instead of 500]
+
500 status code returns for an invalid encoded URI.  It also creates a FFDC log.  It can cause a false alarm for the server administrator.  A `400 Bad Request` should be returned.
+

+
A map within the websocket code is not properly cleaned up during session expiration and may result in a out-of-memory error.  Websocket sessions are fairly small, so it take a long time to notice.  However, depends on the number of websocket connections the server handles. 

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/24925[UUID not working as GeneratedValue Id in some cases]
+

Jakarta Persistence 3.1 added the ability to have a UUID be the id and to also be generated.  In some cases such as the following, where `strategy = GenerationType.UUID` or strategy is omitted (defaulting to AUTO), an IllegalArgumentException is being raised when trying to save an entity for the first time (when it starts out without an id, needing it generated).

```
