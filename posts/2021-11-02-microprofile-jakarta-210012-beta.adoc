Open Liberty 21.0.0.12-beta switches MicroProfile features to the jakarta namespace, allowing you to use MicroProfile together with Jakarta EE 9.1 applications. This release also features updates to MicroProfile OpenAPI, as it provides support for multiple applications.

We have two beta packages for link:{url-about}[Open Liberty]:

* <<allbeta, All Beta Features>>: a larger package that contains all Open Liberty beta features (including Jakarta EE 9 beta features) and GA features and functions.
* <<jakarta, Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features>>: a lightweight package that contains only the Jakarta EE 9 features.

This means that you can now try out our in-development Open Liberty features by just adding the relevant coordinates to your build tools.

If you try either package, <<feedback, let us know what you think>>.
[#allbeta]
== All Beta Features package

The All Beta Features package includes the following beta features:

* <<mp_jwt, MicroProfile JWT 2.0>>
* <<mp_health, MicroProfile Health 4.0>>
* <<mp_metrics, MicroProfile Metrics 4.0>>
* <<mp_openapi, MicroProfile Open API 3.0>>
* <<mp_ft, MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 4.0>>
* <<mp_config, MicroProfile Config 3.0>>
* <<mpOpenApi_multiple_apps, Support multiple applications in mpOpenApi-2.0>>

[#mp_jwt]
=== MicroProfile JWT 2.0

With this beta, the MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.0 feature replaces `javax` with `jakarta` in Jakarta package names allowing it to be used for Jakarta EE 9.1 applications.
The old MicroProfile JSON Web Token 1.2 feature does not provide support for Jakarta EE 9.1 applications. Enabling `mpJwt-2.0` instead of `mpJwt-1.2` will allow those applications to use the MicroProfile JSON Web Token feature.

You can enable the MicroProfile JSON Web Token 2.0 feature by using the `mpJwt-2.0` feature in the server.xml file:

[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>              
  <feature>mpJwt-2.0</feature>
</featureManager>
----

All the attributes of the `mpJwt` element and all the current MP Config properties from the MP JWT 1.2 specification remain the same.

[#mpOpenApi_multiple_apps]
=== Support multiple applications in mpOpenApi-2.0

MicroProfile OpenAPI helps you document the REST endpoints of your application by creating and serving documentation in the OpenAPI format.

MicroProfile OpenAPI can now create OpenAPI documentation for more than one application. Previously, only the first deployed web module which included a JAX-RS application would be documented. When two or more web modules containing JAX-RS applications are deployed, the MicroProfile OpenAPI feature can now create documentation for each of them and then merge that documentation together.

To enable this functionality, you must set the MicroProfile Config property `mp.openapi.extensions.liberty.merged.include=all`, e.g. by adding this to your `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<variable name="mp.openapi.extensions.liberty.merged.include" value="all"/>
----

With this property set, deploy several JAX-RS applications and visit `/openapi/ui` on your Open Liberty server where you should see documentation for all the applications.

The following MP Config properties can be used to configure this feature:

|===
|Name               |Description              |Default               |Values

|`mp.openapi.extensions.liberty.merged.include` | List of modules which should be included in the merged OpenAPI documentation | `first`
a| 
* `all` (to include all applications)
* `first` (to include only the first web module deployed, matching the previous behavior)
* comma-separated list of `<appname>` (to include individual applications) and `<appname>/<modulename>` (to include individual modules within an EAR)
|`mp.openapi.extensions.liberty.merged.exclude`
a| 
* List of modules which should be excluded from the merged OpenAPI documentation
* Takes priority over the list of included modules
| `none`
a|
* none (to exclude nothing)
* comma-separated list of <appname> (to exclude individual applications) and <appname>/<modulename> (to exclude individual modules within an EAR)
|`mp.openapi.extensions.liberty.merged.info`| This property sets the info section of the final Open API document | `none`
a|
* The value must be a valid OpenAPI info section in JSON format. If this property is set, the info section in the final OpenAPI document is replaced with the value of the property. This replacement is made after any merging is completed.

[#jakarta]
== Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package

Open Liberty is the first vendor product to be Jakarta EE Web Profile 9.0 compatible since the 21.0.0.2-beta release. Open Liberty is also the first vendor product to be added to the link:https://jakarta.ee/compatibility/#tab-9[Jakarta EE Platform 9.0 compatability list], with the release of 21.0.0.3-beta. 
Open Liberty 21.0.0.6-beta further expanded on this compatability by including new Jakarta EE9 supporting features, and 21.0.0.12-beta offers the same compatability with Jakarta EE9 with performance enhancements. 

Enable the Jakarta EE 9 beta features in your app's `server.xml`. You can enable the individual features you want or you can just add the Jakarta EE 9 convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 9 beta features at once:

[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jakartaee-9.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

Or you can add the Web Profile convenience feature to enable all of the Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile beta features at once:

[source, xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>webProfile-9.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

=== Try it now

To try out these Jakarta EE 9 features on Open Liberty in a lightweight package, just update your build tools to pull the Open Liberty Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package instead of the main release. The beta works with Java SE 17, Java SE 11, or Java SE 8.
