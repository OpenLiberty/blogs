= MicroProfile Rest Client 2.0 - First Look
Andy McCright <https://github.com/andymc12>

The latest release of MicroProfile's type-safe REST client has a lot of new and exciting features. In this post, we'll
take a look at some of the new features and how you can use them in Open Liberty, including:

- <<query-param-style,Using QueryParamStyle to specify how collections of query parameters should be formatted>>
- <<proxy-server,Proxy server support>>
- <<auto-redirects,Automatically following redirects>>
- <<sse-support,Support for Server Sent Events (SSEs)>>

== Getting started

The MicroProfile Rest Client 2.0 implementation is new in Open Liberty 21.0.0.3 - so make sure you are using the latest
version of Liberty. Next, you will need to add the following link:{url-prefix}/guides/maven-intro.html[Maven] dependency
to your pom.xml:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>microprofile-rest-client-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

or, if you use link:{url-prefix}/guides/gradle-intro.html[Gradle]:
[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    compileOnly group: 'org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client', name: 'microprofile-rest-client-api', version: '2.0'
}
----

Also, make sure to configure your Liberty server with the `mpRestClient-2.0` feature in the server.xml:
[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>mpRestClient-2.0</feature>
    <!-- ... -->
  </featureManager>
  <!-- ... -->
</server>
----

That's it! Now that we've got our development and deployment environments set up, it's time to code!


[#query-param-style]
== Using QueryParamStyle to specify how collections of query parameters should be formatted

Rest Client interfaces can specify query parameters using the `@QueryParam("paramName")` annotation, but often a server
will require that multi-valued query parameters must be formatted in a certain way. For example, suppose we have a
client interface like:
[source,java]
----
@RegisterRestClient
public interface MyClient {
    @GET
    String multiValues(@QueryParam("myParam") List<String> values);
}
----
By default, if a caller invokes the client with `multiValues(Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c"))` the MP Rest Client will
produce an HTTP request with multiple key/value pairs - something like: `?myParam=a&myParam=b&myParam=c`.

Although most servers will handle that just fine, some servers might require the HTTP request to be a single key with a 
comma-separated list of values, like: `?myParam=a,b,c`

Still other servers will require array-like syntax, such as: `?myParam[]=a&myParam[]=b&myParam[]=c`

In order to support those other server types, you can now use the `QueryParamStyle` enum when building the client
instance - for example:

[source,java]
----
MyClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                                   .queryParamStyle(QueryParamStyle.COMMA_SEPARATED)
                                   //...
                                   .build(MyClient.class);
----

Alternatively, you can declare the query parameter style through 
https://www.openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config-intro.html[MP Config] by using a property like:

`com.mypkg.MyClient/mp-rest/queryParamStyle=ARRAY_PAIRS`

The following table lists the `QueryParamStyle` enum values and provides an example of the corresponding output for
each value.

.QueryParamStyle Options
|=======================
|Enum Value            | Output Example
|MULTI_PAIRS (default) | `?myParam=a&myParam=b&myParam=c`
|COMMA_SEPARATED       | `?myParam=a,b,c`
|ARRAY_PAIRS           | `?myParam[]=a&myParam[]=b&myParam[]=c`
|=======================

[#proxy-server]
== Proxy server support

You might need to use a proxy server to access some RESTful endpoints. MicroProfile Rest Client 2.0 makes it easier
and more portable to specify a proxy server with the new `proxyAddress(host, port)` method on the `RestClientBuilder`
class. For example, suppose you need to access an endpoint via a proxy server at `myproxy.xyz.com` on port `1080`. You
could build your rest client instance with code like:

[source,java]
----
MyClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                                   .proxyAddress("myproxy.xyz.com", 1080)
                                   //...
                                   .build(MyClient.class);
----

Alternatively, you can specify the proxy address via MP Config with a property like:

`com.mypkg.MyClient/mp-rest/proxyAddress=myproxy.xyz.com:1080`

Note that for portability, this approach to setting the proxy server host and port is preferred to using vendor-specific
properties such as `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.proxy.host` and `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.proxy.port`, though these
properties will still work. For proxy authentication, you can still use the `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.proxy.username` and
`com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.proxy.password` properties. For example:
[source,java]
----
MyClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                                   .proxyAddress(myproxy.xyz.com, 1080)
                                   .property("com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.proxy.username", "andymc12")
                                   .property("com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.proxy.password", "12345") //same as my luggage! :)
                                   //...
                                   .build(MyClient.class);
----

[#auto-redirects]
== Automatically following redirects

If a RESTful resource has been relocated, often the HTTP response code will be in the 300 range and will indicate the
new location. Rather than handling the 3XX response and manually issuing a new request, MP Rest Client 2.0 allows rest
client instances to automatically follow redirects. You can configure a client to automatically follow redirects either
programmatically, when you build the client instance, or via MP Config. Here is an example of configuring auto-redirect
via the `RestClientBuilder` API:

[source,java]
----
MyClient client = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                                   .followRedirects(true)
                                   //...
                                   .build(MyClient.class);
----

And here is how you would configure it via MP Config:

`com.mypkg.MyClient/mp-rest/followRedirects=true`

[#sse-support]
== Support for Server Sent Events (SSEs)

link:https://openliberty.io/guides/reactive-messaging-sse.html[Server Sent Events], part of the HTML 5 spec, enable a
server to push data to a client asynchronously via events, over HTTP. The JAX-RS 2.1 spec enabled SSE
support for both the client and server. Now you can consume SSE events from the type-safe MP Rest Client.

The MP Rest Client specification uses the link:http://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams] APIs to consume
events. A client interface capable of consuming SSEs looks something like this:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterRestClient
public interface SseClient {
    @GET
    @Path("/path/sse")
    @Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
    Publisher<String> getStrings();

    @GET
    @Path("/path/sse2")
    @Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)
    Publisher<InboundSseEvent> getEvents();
}
----

First, the method (or interface) must be annotated with `@Produces(MediaType.SERVER_SENT_EVENTS)` to indicate that it
expects the server to produce SSEs. Next, the method's return type must be `org.reactivestreams.Publisher`. The generic
type can be `javax.ws.rs.sse.InboundSseEvent` (from JAX-RS), a primitive, a String, or a complex type. Complex types can
only be used if;

1) the server only sends one type of event (e.g. only sends `WeatherEvents` - then `Publisher<WeatherEvent>` would be
applicable)

_and_

2) there is a registered entity provider capable of converting the events (e.g. `MessageBodyReader<WeatherEvent>`).

In most cases, if the remote server sends events using JSON, you can enable the `jsonb-1.0` feature in your Liberty
server, which will automatically register a JSON-B-based entity provider.


Once you invoke one of these methods, you can register one or more `Subscriber` instances to the
`Publisher`. Each subscriber will be notified on receipt of a new event or if the connection to the server has been
closed.
