Open Liberty 22.0.0.8-beta separates stack trace from logged messages by offering new fields for Open Liberty JSON logging and for the Logstash Collector feature. This enables easier-to-read visualizations in downstream log analysis tools.

The link:{url-about}[Open Liberty] 22.0.0.8-beta includes the following beta features (along with all GA features):

* <<stack_trace, Stack trace separated from logged messages in logging records>>

[#stack_trace]
== Stack trace separated from logged messages in logging records

The stack trace is now separated from logged messages in logging records so that log analysis tools can present them more clearly. This makes visualizations of the logs by downstream log analysis tools easier to read when you are identifying any issues encountered by the application. Previously, any logging record originating from a Java Logger object that made use of any of the methods that accept a `Throwable` parameter would simply append the stack trace to the existing `message` field. Keeping the `message` field solely for the logged message and having a separate field for the stack trace and exception type enhances the effectiveness of log analysis tools down stream.

Java's link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html[Logging API] provides methods that allow you to include a `Throwable` as a parameter. When the `Throwable` object is used, Open Liberty's JSON logging provides two new fields, `ibm_stackTrace` and `ibm_exceptionName`, and the Open Liberty link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/logstashCollector-1.0.html[Logstash Collector] feature provides two new fields, `stackTrace` and `exceptionName`. The stack trace fields present only the stack trace of the `Throwable` object. The exception name fields present the type of exception of the `Throwable` object.

*Example:*

For the example we will only be showing the message log record for Open Liberty's JSON logging.

Application with the following code snippet:
[source, java]
----
Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyResource.class.getCanonicalName());
Exception exception = new IllegalArgumentException("ouch");
logger.log(Level.INFO, "exception message", exception);
----

Previous Open Liberty JSON logging output:

[source, json]
----
{
    "type": "liberty_message",
    ...
    "message": “exception message  java.lang.RuntimeException: ouch\r\n\tatmy.package.MyResource.get(MyResource.java:32)\r\n\tatmy.package.MyResource.get(MyResource.java:20)\r\n...",
    ...
}
----

New Open Liberty JSON logging output:

[source, json]
----
{
    "type": "liberty_message",
    ...
    "message": “exception message",
    "ibm_exceptionName":"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException",
    "ibm_stackTrace":"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: ouch\r\n\tat my.package.MyResource.get(MyResource.java:20)\r\n...",
    ...
}
