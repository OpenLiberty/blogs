// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
// Do not remove or edit the variables on the lines beneath the author name.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default

// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to

// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]

== Notable bugs fixed in this release


We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A24002+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 24.0.0.2].

+

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/27396[Handling of locked Transaction Log Lease Table needs improvment]
+
If the Transaction Service is logging to a database and using recoveryGroups, locking the lease table (for example during a DB backup) exhibits the following behaviour:
+
App servers trying to update the lease will hang/fail after timeout, so leases will be stale (expected in such a scenario)
App servers trying to look for stale leases will read the leases and increase the stale lease detection count for other app servers and potentially trigger peer recovery if the leaseExpiryThreshold is exceeded.  The issue here is that the leaseExpiryThreshold could easeily be breached.  The reason why the reading of the leases works without hanging is because a standard SELECT is used (and isolation level is default TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED) - changing that to SELECT FOR UPDATE (and equivalents in different database servers) should allow the leaseExpiryThreshold (when >1) to prevent this situation triggering peer recovery (where it should be noted, timestamp staleness for the leases and logs would be subject to a race condition - the one that the leaseExpiryThreshold was intended to address).

== New and updated guides since the previous release
As Open Liberty features and functionality continue to grow, we continue to add link:https://openliberty.io/guides/?search=new&key=tag[new guides to openliberty.io] on those topics to make their adoption as easy as possible.  Existing guides also receive updates to address any reported bugs/issues, keep their content current, and expand what their topic covers.

// // // // // // // //
// In the following section, list any new guides, or changes/updates to existing guides.  
// The following is an example of how the list can be structured (similar to the bugs section):
