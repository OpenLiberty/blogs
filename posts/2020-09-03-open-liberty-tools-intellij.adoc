The new Open Liberty Tools IntelliJ extension provides you with an easier way to view and interact with your Open Liberty projects in IntelliJ IDEA.  

You can start Open Liberty in dev mode, make changes to your application while the server is running, debug your application, and run tests and view the corresponding test reports all through the Liberty Dev Dashboard.

In prior blogs, we have shown you how Open Liberty dev mode can be https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/10/22/liberty-dev-mode.html[run from a command line with Maven] and with https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/03/11/gradle-dev-mode-open-liberty.html[Gradle].  In this blog post, you will see how the Open Liberty Tools extension improves the developer experience by conveniently displaying Open Liberty projects and dev mode interactions within IntelliJ.  

Check out a demo of Open Liberty Toosl for IntelliJ:

== Installing the extension

Install the https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14856-open-liberty-tools[Open Liberty Tools extension from the IntelliJ Plugins Marketplace].

== Setting up the project

For Maven projects, dev mode requires the Liberty Maven Plugin. Specify the Liberty Maven Plugin in your project’s `pom.xml` file.
[source,xml]
----
    <plugin>
        <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
        <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.2.2</version>
    </plugin>
----

For Gradle projects, dev mode requires the Liberty Gradle Plugin. Specify the Liberty Gradle Plugin in your project’s `build.gradle` file.
[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.0'
    }
}
----

== Interacting with dev mode

Once the Liberty Maven Plugin is specified in your `pom.xml` file or the Liberty Gradle Plugin is specified in your `build.gradle` file, your project name will be listed under the Liberty Dev Dashboard.  You can interact with dev mode by right-clicking on your project name, or selecting a command from the drop-down list below the project name.  Alternatively, you can use the "Run Liberty Dev Task” option in the dashboard toolbar.

== Commands

Running a command through the Liberty Dev Dashboard means you no longer need to manually run each dev mode command via command line.  Common commands include starting dev mode, running tests, and viewing test reports. See the https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-tools-intellij#commands[full list of commands] for more detail.
