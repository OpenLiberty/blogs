In this release of Open Liberty Beta you can try the new features for MicroProfile 4.0 which are Fault Tolerance 3.0, Matric 3.0, Health 3.0 and OpenTracing 2.0 plus more Jakarta EE 9 features.

We have two beta packages for link:{url-about}[Open Liberty]:

* <<allbeta, All Beta Features>>: a new, larger package that contains all Open Liberty beta features (including Jakarta EE 9 beta features) and GA features and functions.
* <<jakarta, Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features>>: a lightweight package that contains only the Jakarta EE 9 features.

This means that you can now try out our in-development Open Liberty features by just adding the relevant coordinates to your build tools (either the All Beta Features package or the Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package, depending on what you want to try).

If you try either package, <<feedback, let us know what you think>>.

[#allbeta]
== All Beta Features package

image::/img/blog/logos/docs_microprofile_logo.png[MicroProfile Logo,width=70%,align="center"]

The All Beta Features package includes the following beta features:

* <<fault, MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 3.0>>
* <<metric, MicroProfile Metric 3.0>>
* <<health, MicroProfile Health 3.0>>
* <<opentracing, MicroProfile OpenTracing 2.0>>
* <<jakarta, Jakarta EE 9 Beta Features package>>


[#fault]
=== MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 3.0

MicroProfile Fault Tolerance allows you to easily apply strategies for mitigating failure to their code. It provides annotations which you can add to methods to use bulkhead, circuit breaker, retry, timeout and fallback strategies.

Fault Tolerance 3.0 overhauls the metrics that are automatically exported by Fault Tolerance to take advantage of tags and make it easier to use those metrics to understand when and where your application is failing.

Information which was previously included in the metric name is now included as metric tags, making it much easier to query for data from multiple methods and pick out which, if any, is causing issues.

Example:

Old metric: `application:ft.<name>.timeout.callsTimedOut.total`

New metric: `base:ft.timeout.calls.total{method="<name>", timedOut="true"}``


==== Try it now 

Enable Fault Tolerance 3.0 and CDI in the `server.xml`, along with any other features you're using.

[source, xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpFaultTolerance-3.0</feature>
  <feature>cdi-2.0</feature>
  <feature>jaxrs-2.1</feature>
</featureManager>
----

Add any of the Fault Tolerance annotations to a business method of a CDI bean.

[source, java]
----
@Retry(5)
public User lookupUserFromRegistry(String name) {
  return registry.getUser(name);
}
----

When that method is called as a a CDI business method, the fault tolerance strategy will be used. In this example, if `lookupUserFromRegistry()` would throw an exception, it will instead be retried up to five times.

[#metric]
=== MicroProfile Metric 3.0

MicroProfile Metrics 3.0 (as part of MicroProfile 4.0) introduces new metric values for the existing SimpleTimer and Timer metrics. Additionally a new REST metric is introduced for better monitoring and handling of unmapped exceptions. Manual configuration for re-usability has been removed. A notable change to the MicroProfile Metrics programming model regarding CDI Producers has been made. Lastly a medley of API improvements and refactoring have been added in this release.

==== SimpleTimer
The SimpleTimer metric now tracks and reports the highest and lowest recorded time duration of the previous complete minute. See link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-metrics-3.0-RC1/apidocs/index.html?org/eclipse/microprofile/metrics/SimpleTimer.html[SimpleTimer Javadoc] for more information.

==== Timer
The Time metric now tracks and reports the total elapsed time duration. See link:https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-metrics-3.0-RC1/apidocs/index.html?org/eclipse/microprofile/metrics/Timer.html[Timer Javadoc] for more information.

==== REST metric
A new `REST.request.unmappedException.total` metric that is backed by a counter metric has been introduced. Similar to the `REST.request` metric, there will be one unique metric for each REST endpoint identified by a class and method label. The new REST metric will count the amount of times the request ends in an unmapped exception. The REST.request metric corresponding to this REST endpoint will not record any values if an unmapped exception has occured.

==== CDI Producer
The `@Metrics` annotation will no longer support the method target (i.e it can not be annotated on a method). Additionally, it will not support usage with CDI Producers.

==== Try it now 

Enable Metrics 3.0 in the `server.xml`, along with any other features you're using.

[#health]
=== MicroProfile Health 3.0

MicroProfile Health 3.0 enables you to provide your own health check procedures to be invoked by Open Liberty, to verify the health of your microservice.

MicroProfile Health allows services to report their health, and it publishes the overall health status to a defined endpoint. A service reports UP if it is available and reports DOWN if it is unavailable. MicroProfile Health reports an individual service status at the endpoint and indicates the overall status as UP if all the services are UP. A service orchestrator can then use the health statuses to make decisions.

MicroProfile Health checks its own health by performing necessary self-checks and then reports its overall status by implementing the API provided by MicroProfile Health. A self-check can be a check on anything that the service needs, such as a dependency, a successful connection to an endpoint, a system property, a database connection, or the availability of required resources. MicroProfile offers checks for both liveness and readiness.

In the `mpHealth-3.0` feature for Open Liberty: 

* The overall default Readiness status was changed to DOWN, with an empty response until all the deployed application(s) have been started. A new MicroProfile Config property (`mp.health.default.readiness.empty.response=UP`) is introduced to change the overall default Readiness check status to UP, during application start up, that do not have any user-defined health checks.

* The `HealthCheckResponseBuilder.state(Boolean UP)` method was also renamed to `HealthCheckResponseBuilder.status(Boolean UP)` for HealthCheckResponse deserialization compatibility, where the JSON health check response string can now be deserialized into an HealthCheckResponse object.

* The deprecated `@Health` qualifier was removed, and you should use the `@Liveness` or `@Readiness` qualifiers in your HealthCheck implementations, as appropriate.

Applications are expected to provide health check procedures by implementing the HealthCheck interface with the `@Liveness` or `@Readiness` annotations. These are used by Open Liberty to verify the Liveness or Readiness of the application, respectively. Add the logic of your health check in the call() method, and return the `HealthCheckResponse` object, by using the simple up()/down() methods from the API:

[source, java]
----
**Liveness Check**
@Liveness
@ApplicationScoped
public class AppLiveCheck implements HealthCheck {
...
    @Override
     public HealthCheckResponse call() {
       ...
       HealthCheckResponse.up("my-liveness-check");
       ...
     }
}

**Readiness Check**
@Readiness
@ApplicationScoped
public class AppReadyCheck implements HealthCheck {
...
    @Override
     public HealthCheckResponse call() {
       ...
       HealthCheckResponse.named("my-app-readiness").status(isMyAppReady()).build();
       ...
     }
}
...
----

To view the status of each health check, access the either the `http://<hostname>:<port>/health/live` or `http://<hostname>:<port>/health/ready endpoints`.

[#opentracing]
=== MicroProfile OpenTracing 2.0

MicroProfile OpenTracing 2.0 can be used to profile and monitor applications built using microservice architecture.

MicroProfile OpenTracing 2.0 has upgraded the OpenTracing API to version 0.33.0.  This allows the 
use of tracing backends and their libraries that are built on OpenTracing API 0.33.0.

==== Try it now

Include the following in the `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
    <feature>mpOpenTracing-2.0</feature>
----

Also configure a tracing backend such as Jaeger or Zipkin. +
For Jaeger, add the following maven dependencies in the application's pom.xml.

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jaegertracing</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaeger-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.30</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-jdk14</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.30</version>
</dependency>
----

You can find out more about about configuring Jaeger settings using environment variables by looking 
at link:https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java/blob/v1.2.0/jaeger-core/README.md[jaeger-client-java readme].

For the `JAEGER_PASSWORD` environment variable, the password can be encoded using the `securityUtility` command.

Depending on Jaeger’s sampling settings `JAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE` and `JAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM`, 
Jaeger may not report every span created by the applications.

For Zipkin, take a look at the link:https://github.com/WASdev/sample.opentracing.zipkintracer[sample project] to see how to implement a tracer for Liberty.

Define your application in the `server.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
<webApplication location="yourapp.war" contextRoot="/yourapp">
    <!-- enable visibility to third party APIs -->
    <classloader apiTypeVisibility="+third-party" />
</webApplication>
----

Once you have hit some JAX-RS endpoints of your application, you should be able to find spans in the user interface of your tracing backend.
