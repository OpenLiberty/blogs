Many organizations are struggling with configuration drift, and GitOps provides a robust solution. If you're unfamiliar with what configuration drift is or how GitOps can help mitigate it, check out part 1 of this two part series: link:{url-prefix}/blog/2024/03/12/argocd-drift-pt1.html[Configuration drift: Why its bad and how to solve it with GitOps and ArgoCD]

In this post, part 2 of this series, we will demonstrate how the solutions introduced in part 1 can be practically applied. We will walk you through the deployment of an Open Liberty application to a Kubernetes cluster using a continuous deployment approach with GitOps and ArgoCD. ArgoCD is a leading GitOps tool that automates application deployment and ensures configuration consistency, effectively preventing configuration drift.

== Preparing your cluster

In this post, we assume you have some form of Kubernetes cluster that you can access using the `kubectl` CLI or `oc` CLI if on OpenShift. 

=== Simplifying deployment with the Open Liberty Operator

The Open Liberty Operator streamlines the deployment and management of Open Liberty applications on Kubernetes. Instead of manually crafting Kubernetes resources like services, deployments, and routes, the operator requires us to define only a few application details to automatically generate the required Kubernetes resources - saving us time and effort. Furthermore, it simplifies day 2 operations such as traces and heap dumps when needed. For more on the Open Liberty Operator, check out the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/open-liberty-operator.html[documentation].

To get these benefits, we use the Open Liberty Operator to deploy an application with the following commands, which install the operator with its default configuration (watching all namespaces):
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator.git
kubectl create namespace open-liberty
kubectl apply --server-side -k open-liberty-operator/deploy/releases/1.2.2/kustomize/overlays/watch-all-namespaces
```

For a more detailed tutorial on using the Open Liberty Operator, see our interactive guide: https://openliberty.io/guides/openliberty-operator-intro.html[Deploying a microservice to Kubernetes using Open Liberty Operator].

[#setup_argocd]
=== Set up ArgoCD for effective GitOps and continuous deployment

ArgoCD follows a GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth to define the desired application state, which we will use to deploy and monitor our Open Liberty configuration repository.  ArgoCD helps us identify any drift that occurs between the current cluster state and the desired state in the configuration repository.  

First, we'll use the following commands from the https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/[Quickstart section] of the ArgoCD docs to create a namespace called `argocd` and install ArgoCD by applying manifests to that namespace.
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

Next, we'll need to get the default Admin credentials to access the ArgoCD user interface (UI).  Using the ArgoCD UI is a great way to get started, allowing us to create our application and identify configuration drift in a visual way.
To get the default Admin password, run the following command:
```
kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```
To access the ArgoCD UI, go to the route of the `argocd-server` and log with the `admin` username and password.

[#setup_gitops_repo]
== Setting up a GitOps repository for your application
Now that you've successfully installed ArgoCD and gained access to its console, the next step is to set up a GitHub repository for ArgoCD to synchronize with.  In our example, we created a deployment directory in the application code repo that we will point ArgoCD to for deployment.  

For this particular example, because it's just a small demo application, we put the deployment configuration in the same repository as the the application code. However, in general, it's better to separate the deployment configuration into a separate repository from the application code. This aligns with recommended best practices to maintain separation between configuration repositories and code repositories. Keeping these separate ensures that infrastructure changes are decoupled from application changes, allowing for more granular control, better audit trails, and reduced risk of unintended side-effects.  For more information, see https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/best_practices/[ArgoCD's documentation on best practices].

For the purposes of this post, we'll use the Daytrader7 sample application. This application is built around the concept of an online stock trading system, and the Daytrader7 https://github.com/WASdev/sample.daytrader7#readme[README] provides a comprehensive overview of this application. In this example, we have a `deploy` directory within our existing repository to house the deployment configuration.  This directory contains the manifests for full application deployment as well as annotations that tell ArgoCD which order they should be deployed in.  

To begin, navigate to GitHub and fork this repository: https://github.com/WASdev/sample.daytrader7. Use your forked repository when configuring ArgoCD in the following steps.

In this example, we have a pre-built container image for the DayTrader sample application pushed to Docker Hub that is used in the `deploy/daytrader7-deploy.yaml` deployment file. For more information on how to containerize your Open Liberty application, check out our interactive guide: https://openliberty.io/guides/docker.html[Using Docker containers to develop microservices].

[#deploy_app_with_gitops]
== Deploying a Java application with GitOps and ArgoCD

Now that you have the Git repository forked and ready for deployment, it’s time to configure ArgoCD to deploy the application.

1. Go to the ArgoCD console dashboard.

2. Click **New App** in the console.  
+
This button opens a window where you give ArgoCD the details on the application you want to deploy, as shown in the following image.
[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/configuration-drift-3.png[Creating the App,width=70%,align="center"]
3. For our demo application, enter the following values:
+
**Application Name**: daytrader7
+
**Project**: Leave as "Default". This setting groups applications together for large scale deployments, which is not needed in our case.
+
**SYNC POLICY**: Manual. This configuration option determines whether we want ArgoCD to automatically correct configuration drift or wait for us to manually tell it to. 
+
**SYNC OPTIONS**: Select the **Auto-Create Namespace** box, which creates the namespace if it doesn't already exist.  


Next, scroll down to the configuration section labelled **SOURCE**, as shown in the following image. 

[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/configuration-drift-4.png[Setting the Repo,width=70%,align="center"]
1. Change the **Repository URL** to your newly forked repo. This tells ArgoCD what Git repository has the configuration for the application you want to deploy. 

2. Change the **Path** to the path in the git repo where ArgoCD is looking for deployment files to deploy. 

3. Set the **Cluster URL**. 
+
In this example, we set it to `\https://kubernetes.default.svc`, which is the local cluster URL.

Then, lastly, you will need to set the namespace. In our case, this is daytrader7 (which will be created because we selected the "Auto-Create Namespace" option).


After verifying these options, click Create in the top left.  This creates an "Application" resource that ArgoCD uses to watch the repository we gave it.

[#manually_sync]
=== Manually Syncing your Application with the Repository

Since we chose a manual sync policy, we have to sync the application manually for ArgoCD to deploy it. If you have also selected this option, on the main page of the ArgoCD console, you should see a new tile that looks like this:

[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/configuration-drift-5.png[Argo Dashboard,width=70%,align="center"]

Click the **Sync** button. Then, on the window that appears, click **Sync** again.
To monitor the progress of this application sync, you can click on the **daytrader7** tile.
Over the course of a few minutes, you should see resources being created and the app dashboard should look like this:
[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/configuration-drift-6.png[App deploying,width=70%,align="center"]

This diagram shows the many kubernetes resources created for the application, such as the deployment, pod, and service.  We can also monitor the health of each of these resources and verify they were created properly.  


Now that the application is deployed and all the resources are created we need to make sure it is exposed externally.  This sample sets `spec.expose` to `true`, which automatically creates an external route on OpenShift.  If you are on Kubernetes, you need to either configure a load balancer or an Ingress controller for the application.  Find the URL via:
`oc get routes –n daytrader7` if on OpenShift, 
Or `kubectl get ingress -n daytrader7` if on Kubernetes with Ingress configured.
Then paste the URL in a browser to access the Daytrader login page.

And there we go! We have fully deployed our application with GitOps!

[#gitops_solve_config_drift]
== How GitOps solves configuration drift

Now that we have deployed the app, let's show a scenario where configuration drift occurs and how we can easily correct it.
Let's say a developer changes the memory settings in the configuration file for a quick test.  To represent this, change the memory request found at `spec.resources.requests.memory` from 1024Mi to 2048Mi using either the Kubernetes CLI with `kubectl edit OpenLibertyApplication -n daytrader7 daytrader7` or the console itself.  In a few moments the argo console should show it is out of sync:
[.img_border_light]
image::/img/blog/configuration-drift-outofsync.png[Daytrader Home,width=70%,align="center"]

"Out of Sync" means that some form of configuration drift occured in the application.  We can refer back to the application in the ArgoCD UI to see exactly where it occured.  
Since we set the sync policy to manual, we have to manually tell ArgoCD to correct the configuration drift. Click the `Sync` button to return the configuration to match what is in Git.

== Next Steps
In this blog post, we explored the seamless deployment of an Open Liberty application through the GitOps methodology, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating configuration drift. Whether you're seeking to refine your deployment strategy or embark on a fresh project for an Open Liberty application, we encourage experimenting with GitOps. You can easily extend this approach to automate the deployment of other application dependencies, such as databases.
