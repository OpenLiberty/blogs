=== Java 17 Support

The long awaited release of Java 17 is out and is the first LTS (long term support) release since Java 11's release back in September 2018. It offers a lot of new functionality and environmental changes that you will want to check out. Because it is a milestone release, we know you are excited and ready to try it out with your existing applications and microservices, or maybe write a new one, all running on your favorite server runtime, Open Liberty!

There have been a lot of changes introduced between Java 11 and 17. Here are some of the noteworthy highlights:

== Phasing out the --illegal-access JVM option

By far one of the the biggest impacts to Java development happened over the past couple releases. Java introduced a key play to move Java applications firmly into the modular programming world of the Java Platform Module System (JPMS).

For a quick history review of JPMS, please re-visit the *Introduction of the Java Platform Module System (JPMS)* section of our link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/02/06/java-11.html[Open Liberty and Java 11 blog].

Starting in Java 16 with link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/396[JEP 396], strong encapsulation of the JDK internal elements took another step.  This effectively means the "kill" switch default for the JVM option `--illegal-access` was changed from `permit`, permitting module access violations, to `deny`, denying this access and instead throwing an `IllegalAccessException` when a violation occurs.

Then, in Java 17 with link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/403[JEP 403], they took strong encapsulation further.  Now, while the JVM option `--illegal-access` is still recognized as a valid JVM argument, it is effectively hard coded to `deny`, its passed in value is ignored and the following warning message is issued.

```
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: Ignoring option --illegal-access=permit; support was removed in 17.0
```

Not to worry though.  You still have more time if your applications or dependencies are not completely ready to run in the modularized Java world.  There are some more precise JVM arguments, primarily `--add-opens` and `--add-exports`, that can help bridge the gap until you, and your applications, are fully modular ready.  These arguments allow the individual module exceptions to the JPMS rules that your applications might need.

== How to run Open Liberty on Java 17

You will need a copy of Java 17.  To try this out, download Java 17 Temurin from link:https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk17[adoptium.net].

Then you will need Open Liberty 21.0.0.10, or newer. To run your applications on Open Liberty 21.0.0.10, check out <<run, Run your apps using 21.0.0.10>>.

There are a number of ways to control the Java executable used by the Open Liberty server. The following list describes the order of precedence:

. `JAVA_HOME` in `${server.config.dir}/server.env`
. `JAVA_HOME` in `${wlp.install.dir}/etc/server.env`
. `JAVA_HOME` set in the environment
. searching the `PATH` in the environment

 For more information, please visit our link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/config/server-configuration-overview.html[server configuration documentation].
Happy Java 17 experimenting!

== Notable bugs fixed in this release

We’ve spent some time fixing bugs. The following sections describe just some of the issues resolved in this release. If you’re interested, here’s the  link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues?q=label%3Arelease%3A21.0.0.10+label%3A%22release+bug%22[full list of bugs fixed in 21.0.0.10].

* link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/18393[SPNEGO does not work with Java 11 or higher]
+
In the release of Open Liberty 21.0.0.9, a regression was introduced which prevented the `Krb5LoginModule` class from being found when authenticating using Kerberos on Java 11 or higher. This issue caused some users to be presented with an `Error 403` or `Authentication Failed` when authenticating using the `spnego-1.0` feature. This issue has been fixed by reverting the underlying code back to the way it was prior to it being modified. 

== Get Open Liberty 21.0.0.10 now
