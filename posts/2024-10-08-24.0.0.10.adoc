== Support for Java 23 in Open Liberty

Java 23 is the latest release of Java, released on September 17th 2024. It contains new features and enhancements over previous versions of Java. However, Java 23 is not a long term support (LTS) release and support for it will be dropped when the next version of Java is supported. It offers some new functionality and changes that you are going to want to check out for yourself.

== Versionless features for standalone MicroProfile Liberty features

In link:{url-prefix}/blog/2024/08/13/24.0.0.8.html#versionless[24.0.0.8], Open Liberty introduced versionless MicroProfile features. Versionless features allow you to easily use Liberty features without needing to know what feature version to use. The initial release of versionless features did not include the stand-alone MicroProfile technologies that are not part of the MicroProfile releases, but can work with the other MicroProfile features. An example of such a feature is `mpContextPropagation-1.3`.

In 24.0.0.10, Open Liberty adds versionless features for stand-alone MicroProfile features. The following versionless features were added:

- `mpContextPropagation`
- `mpGraphQL`
- `mpReactiveMessaging`
- `mpReactiveStreams`

The following `server.xml` configuration file uses the MicroProfile platform `microProfile-6.1` with the new versionless stand-alone features:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
    <platform>microProfile-6.1</platform>
    <feature>mpContextPropagation</feature>
    <feature>mpGraphQL</feature>
    <feature>mpReactiveMessaging</feature>
    <feature>mpReactiveStreams</feature>
</featureManager>
----

Learn more and check out the full collection of available platforms and versionless features in the link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/versionless-features.html[Open Liberty docs]. Stay tuned for more versionless features and platforms in future releases.
