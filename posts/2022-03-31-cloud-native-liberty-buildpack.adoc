//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appriopriate/specific image (for example if present an image that is being used in the post). 
// However, it can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title
//
// Replace SECOND_AUTHOR_NAME with the name of the second author.
// Replace SECOND_GITHUB_USERNAME with the GitHub user name of the second author.
// Replace THIRD_AUTHOR_NAME with the name of the third author. And so on for fourth, fifth, etc authors.
// Replace THIRD_GITHUB_USERNAME with the GitHub user name of the third author. And so on for fourth, fifth, etc authors.
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as first author.
// Replace GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
//
// Replace AUTHOR_NAME with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-02-12-faster-startup-Java-applications-criu.adoc
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around
// screenshots but not around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark backgrounds.
// Once again make sure to double check how it looks
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

== What is a buildpack?

A buildpack is a set of executables that inspects your app source code and creates a plan to build and run your application.  

Paketo buildpacks are toolkits and workflows for building reproducible container images from source code.

The Paketo Cloud Native Liberty buildpack provides the Open Liberty runtime to a workflow that produces an OCI image that can run just about anywhere.

== What do you need?
* Your application source

* link:https://hub.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community[Docker]

* The link:https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/[pack CLI]

== Let's get started!

Download the sample getting started app:
[source]
git clone https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started.git
cd guide-getting-started/start

Set a default builder:
[source]
pack config default-builder paketobuildpacks/builder:base

Build the app:
[source]
pack build myapp --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty

Your application now is ready to run. 

[source]

== You can build from an on-prem Open Liberty installation
Using a Liberty packaged server
[source]
bin/server package defaultServer --include=usr

The packaged server can then be supplied to the build using the `--path` argument:
[source]
pack build --path <packaged-server-zip-path> --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty myapp 

Or to build from a Liberty server installation, change your working directory to the installation root containing the wlp directory and run:
[source]
pack build --env BP_JAVA_APP_SERVER=liberty myapp
