Open Liberty 21.0.0.5 comes complete with a new Kerberos authentication method, allowing for the use of an LDAP user registry to easily and quickly authorize connections originating from the same source. Also included is the ability to create and exchange multipart payloads using JAX-RS clients and services.

* <<multi, Build multipart payloads for your JAX-RS client and services>>

=== LDAP connection support for Kerberos authentication

LDAP bind operations are used to authenticate clients (and the users or applications behind them) to the directory server. This establishes an authorization identity that is used for subsequent operations that are processed on that connection, and specifies the LDAP protocol version that the client uses. Before this update, the `LdapRegistry` element supported binding either anonymously or by using simple authentication with a user (`bindDN`) and password (`bindPassword`). This update adds an option to bind to LDAP: GSSAPI/Kerberos. Kerberos is an authentication mechanism that allows a client and service to mutually authenticate by a Key Distribution Center (KDC). In Open Liberty 21.0.0.5,  you can use either a Kerberos credential cache (ccache) or a Kerberos keytab file.

To update an `LdapRegistry` to use the GSSAPI/Kerberos option, you can set the bind authentication mechanism type using the new `LdapRegistry` attribute, `bindAuthMechanism`:

[source, xml]
----
bindAuthMechanism="GSSAPI"
----

You also need the Kerberos principal or Service Principal Name:

[source, xml]
----
krb5Principal="user1@EXAMPLE.COM"
----

If you are using a Kerberos credential cache (ticket cache or ccache) to store the Kerberos credentials, add the ticket cache file name to the `LdapRegistry` with the new attribute, `krb5TicketCache`:

[source, xml]
----
krb5TicketCache="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5-user1.cc"
----

If you are using a custom Kerberos configuration file (krb.conf or krb.ini), set the file name using the global Kerberos configuration element:

[source, xml]
----
<kerberos configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>
----

If you are using a Kerberos keytab file to store encrypted keys for principals, set the file using the global Kerberos configuration element:

[source, xml]
----
<kerberos keytab="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.keytab" configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>
----

If the Kerberos configuration file is not defined, Open Liberty will attempt to resolve by using the JDK default locations and the operating system default locations.

For the Kerberos credentials, the locations are checked in the following order: the ticket cache (if provided), the configured keytab file, and finally the JDK default location.

The following example shows how to configure the `LdapRegistry` element using a ticket cache and custom Kerberos config file:

[source, xml]
----
<kerberos keytab= configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf"/>

<ldapRegistry id="LDAP" realm="SampleLdapADRealm" host="ldap_hostname" port="389" ignoreCase="true" baseDN="DC=example,DC=com" bindAuthMechanism="GSSAPI" krb5Principal="user1@EXAMPLE.COM" krb5TicketCache="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5-user1.cc" ldapType="Custom" />
----

The following example shows how to configure an LDAP Registry using a keytab and custom Kerberos config file:

[source, xml]
----
<kerberos keytab="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.keytab" configFile="${server.config.dir}/security/krb5.conf" />

<ldapRegistry id="LDAP" realm="SampleLdapADRealm" host="ldap_hostname" port="389" ignoreCase="true" baseDN="DC=example,DC=com" bindAuthMechanism="GSSAPI" krb5Principal="user1@EXAMPLE.COM" ldapType="Custom" />
----

For more information on `LdapRegistry`, see the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/ldapRegistry-3.0.html[LDAP User Registry documentation].

To enable this new beta function in your app, pull the All Beta Features package and add the LDAP User Registry 3.0 feature to your `server.xml` file:

[source, xml]

<featureManager>
  <feature>ldapRegistry-3.0</feature>

[#multi]
== Build multipart payloads for your JAX-RS client and services

Often, a RESTful service or client will need to send multiple disparate pieces of data in the same request, for example, uploading a resume/CV with a picture and text for name and address. This is usually done using `multipart/form-data`.

While Liberty currently has APIs to enable users to _receive_ multipart/form-data payloads, it does not have any APIs to enable users to _send_ multipart payloads - until now. With the new `AttachmentBuilder` API, users can now send multipart requests from their JAX-RS clients or send multipart payloads as responses from their JAX-RS resources.

To send a multipart request, you will need to enable the `jaxrs-2.0` or `jaxrs-2.1` feature. Presumably, if you are already using JAX-RS, one of these features will already be enabled. To send a multipart payload, you must send an instance of `List<IAttachment>`.  Each object in that list represents a single attachment part.  Here is an example of creating and sending a multipart request from a JAX-RS client:
[source, java]
----
List<IAttachment> attachments = new ArrayList<>();

attachments.add(AttachmentBuilder.newBuilder("blogPost")
                                 .inputStream(new FileInputStream("/path/to/yesterdaysBlogPost.xml"))
                                 .fileName("myRenamedBlogPost.asciidoc")
                                 .contentType("text/asciidoc")
                                 .contentId("myBlogPostID")
                                 .header("X-PriorityLevel", "Medium")
                                 .build());

attachments.add(AttachmentBuilder.newBuilder("file1")
                                 .inputStream("some.xml", new FileInputStream("/path/to/myPicture.png"))
                                 .contentType("image/png")
                                 .build());

attachments.add(AttachmentBuilder.newBuilder("authorName")
                                 .inputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream("John Doe".getBytes()))
                                 .build());

Response response = client.target(BLOG_SITE_URI)
                          .request()
                          .post(Entity.entity(attachments, MediaType.MULTIPART_FORM_DATA));
