//Blank line here is necessary before starting the body of the post.

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Do not insert any blank lines between any of the lines.
// Do not remove or edit the variables on the lines beneath the author name.
//
// "open-graph-image" is set to OL logo. Whenever possible update this to a more appropriate/specific image (For example if present a image that is being used in the post). However, it
// can be left empty which will set it to the default
//
// "open-graph-image-alt" is a description of what is in the image (not a caption). When changing "open-graph-image" to
// a custom picture, you must provide a custom string for "open-graph-image-alt".
//
// Replace TITLE with the blog post title eg: MicroProfile 3.3 is now available on Open Liberty 20.0.0.4
// Replace mbroz2 with your GitHub username eg: lauracowen
// Replace DESCRIPTION with a short summary (~60 words) of the release (a more succinct version of the first paragraph of the post).
// Replace Michal Broz with your name as you'd like it to be displayed, eg: Laura Cowen
//
// Example post: 2020-04-09-microprofile-3-3-open-liberty-20004.adoc
//
// If adding image into the post add :
// -------------------------
// [.img_border_light]
// image::img/blog/FILE_NAME[IMAGE CAPTION ,width=70%,align="center"]
// -------------------------
// "[.img_border_light]" = This adds a faint grey border around the image to make its edges sharper. Use it around screenshots but not           
// around diagrams. Then double check how it looks.
// There is also a "[.img_border_dark]" class which tends to work best with screenshots that are taken on dark
// backgrounds.
// Change "FILE_NAME" to the name of the image file. Also make sure to put the image into the right folder which is: img/blog
// change the "IMAGE CAPTION" to a couple words of what the image is
// // // // // // // //

RELEASE_SUMMARY

// // // // // // // //
// In the preceding section:
// Leave any instances of `tag::xxxx[]` or `end:xxxx[]` as they are.
//
// Replace RELEASE_SUMMARY with a short paragraph that summarises the release. Start with the lead feature but also summarise what else is new in the release. You will agree which will be the lead feature with the reviewers so you can just leave a placeholder here until after the initial review.
// // // // // // // //

// // // // // // // //
// Replace the following throughout the document:
//   Replace 23.0.0.3 with the version number of Open Liberty, eg: 22.0.0.2

Jakarta Authorization defines a low-level SPI for authorization modules, which are repositories of permissions facilitating subject based security by determining whether a given subject has a given permission, and algorithms to transform security constraints for specific containers (such as Jakarta Servlet or Jakarta Enterprise Beans) into these permissions.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
The Jakarta Authorization 2.0 specification did not have the flexibility to read permissions from the PolicyConfiguration and required complex wrapper code to get the PolicyConfiguration which is used for authorization.

> Jakarta WebSocket 2.1

   Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0): 

> websocket-2.1

   
   </GHA-BLOG-RELATED-FEATURES>

   <GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
3. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.
   

> This feature is for Jakarta Enterprise Edition (EE) application developers. 

   
   </GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>

   <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

> This websocket-2.1 feature, which allows communication for endpoints via the WebSocket protocol, is an implementation of the Jakarta EE 10 WebSocket 2.1 Specification. It includes new features and behavior clarifications from 2.0.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

> There have been several enhancements to improve websocket development. Firstly, when setting up dependencies, developers should notice the API jars have been refactored into client and server jars; however, both APIs are available in the websocket-2.1 feature.

> Developers can now register endpoints outside of the deployment phase of the web application (as there was previously a restriction). HTTP connection upgrades to the websocket protocol can now occur via the API's link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/server/jakarta/websocket/server/servercontainer#upgradeHttpToWebSocket(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object,jakarta.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig,java.util.Map[ServerContainer#upgradeHttpToWebSocket​]) rather than IBM's specific link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/api/v1/content/SSD28V_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.liberty.doc/com.ibm.websphere.appserver.api.wsoc_1.0-javadoc/com/ibm/websphere/wsoc/WsWsocServerContainer.html#doUpgrade(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest,javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse,javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig,java.util.Map[WsWsocServerContainer#doUpgrade]) SPI.

> Another change regards how user properties are handled in websocket sessions. The map returned by EndpointConfig.getUserProperties() is now a copy per endpoint instance (per websocket session). Any new values added only exist for that connection.  This means this map is no longer a singleton in order to pass values to the jakarta.websocket.Session.getUserProperties. More details can be read in the specification document link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/jakarta-websocket-spec-2.1.html#handshake-modification[here].

> An important change developers should note involves WebSocket Client SSL/TLS configuration. Client websocket applications may now set their SSLContext via link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/websocket/2.1/apidocs/client/jakarta/websocket/clientendpointconfig.builder[jakarta.websocket.ClientEndpointConfig.Builder#sslContext], which Open Liberty will use to establish the websocket secure (wss) connection to a server. This option overrides all of Liberty's SSL configurations and should be used with caution. It is recommended to enable SSL communication via the server.xml as described link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was-liberty/base?topic=liberty-enabling-ssl-communication-in[here]. Additionally, SSL may be configured via the link:https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/wsocOutbound.html[wsocOutbound] attribute in the server.xml

   </GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>

   <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
>Jakarta Servlet is a server side feature which defines APIs for handling HTTP requests and generating responses for dynamic web contents. The Open Liberty servlet-6.0 feature is an implementation of the Jakarta EE 10 Servlet 6.0 Specification. It includes a number of new features, specification clarifications as well as deprecation features.
   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
### New Features
> **1. Cookie Attributes**
> Prior to servlet-6.0, there were only a few specific methods that could be set for an application's cookie attributes. There was not an easy way for application to set a new attribute (for example, the recent browser security's SameSite attribute). One of the new features in servlet-6.0 is the ability to set any attribute using a setAttribute() of Cookie or SessionCookieConfig class. 

>Application can programmatically set new cookie attributes during the application's startup using jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer or set a configuration in the deployment descriptor.  Cookie attributes can also set at the request time.

>Session cookie attributes can be configured in the application's deployment descriptor (i.e web.xml), for example:
```
<session-config>
   <cookie-config>
     <name>SampleCookieName</name>
     <domain>my.domain.com</domain>
     <path>/</path>
     <http-only>true</http-only>
     <secure>true</secure>
     <attribute>
        <attribute-name>AttributeName1</attribute-name>
        <attribute-value>Value1</attribute-value>
     </attribute>
     <attribute>
        <attribute-name>OtherAttribute</attribute-name>
        <attribute-value>OtherValue</attribute-value>
     </attribute>
   </cookie-config>
</session-config>
```

>Session cookie attributes can also be set dynamically during the application startup by utilizing the jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer, for example:

```
@Override
public void onStartup(Set<Class<?>> setOfClasses, ServletContext context) throws ServletException {
      SessionCookieConfig scc = context.getSessionCookieConfig();
      scc.setName("MyDynaCookieName");
      scc.setAttribute("MyDynamicAttribute", "DynamicValue");
      ..........
}
```
>In case of conflicts arising from the cookie configuration, the precedence orders (from high to low) are used to resolve the problems: dynamic startup (i.e ServletContainerInitializer) > web.xml .

>Application can also set cookie attributes at request time, for example:
```
Cookie wcCookieAtt = new Cookie(“CookieSetAttributeServlet”, “TestCookieBasic”);
wcCookieAtt.setPath(“BasicPath”);
wcCookieAtt.setDomain(“BasicDomain”);
wcCookieAtt.setHttpOnly(true);
wcCookieAtt.setAttribute(“BasicSetAttribute1”, “BasicAttributeValue1");
wcCookieAtt.setAttribute(“BasicSetAttribute2”, “BasicAttributeValue2");
```

>**2. Application debug enhancement**
>In addition, servlet-6.0 also introduces some new request APIs to aid the application's debugging. Application developer can track or refer to a request using the ServletRequest's getRequestId() or obtain details of the network connection that is being used by the request by calling ServletRequest's getServletConnection.

```
New Class – jakarta.servlet.ServletConnection
     String getConnectionId()
     String getProtocol()
     String getProtocolConnectionId()
     Boolean isSecure()

New methods are added to the existing jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest
     String getRequestId()
     String getProtocolRequestId()
     ServletConnection getServletConnection()
```
### Clarification/Enhancement
>**1. Change to request Cookie header**

>Servlet 6.0 implements the HTTP request cookie's behavior following the RFC 6265 standard which states that HTTP client agents (i.e browsers) are no longer sending back cookie attributes to the application server.

>Previously, request Cookie attributes could be included using the dollar sign (i.e $) prefix a valid attribute name. For example, $Domain=myDomain.com was treated as the Domain attribute for the request Cookie. Starting in Servlet 6.0, $Domain is treated as a new cookie name $Domain; the dollar sign is also part of the cookie name. The only exception to this rule is $Version.

>Example: consider HTTP request with Cookie header:

```Cookie: $Version=1; name1=value1; $Path=/Dollar_Path; $Domain=localhost; $NAME2=DollarNameValue;Domain=DomainValue```

>Prior to Servlet 6.0, server creates: 
```
cookie1: name1 with the associated attributes: Path=/Dollar_Path; Domain=localhost
cookie2: NAME2
cookie3: Domain
```

>Starting from Servlet 6.0, server creates:  
```      
cookie1: name1
cookie2: $Path
cookie3: $Domain
cookie4: $NAME2
cookie5: Domain
```

>**2. URI Path Verification**
```
A direct request is rejected with a 400 Bad Request status if any of the following sequences are presence in the URI:

1. Any "." or ".." segment that has a path parameter (;) (e.g. /path/..;/info)
2. Any path starting with an initial segment of ".." (e.g. /../path/info)
3. Any control characters either encoded or not.

Further verification is performed if the request targets a servlet related resource (i.e. servlet, JSP, or static files).  The request is rejected with 400 Bad Request status if its URI contains the following:
4. The fragment (#) character either encoded (%23) or not.
5. The encoded dot (%2E) character.
6. The encoded forward-slash (%2F) character.
7. The back-slash character either encoded (%5C) or not.

Note: the URI path verification is not applied to the query string
```

>To disable  the request URI encoded characters verification (4-7), application can configure in its web.xml
```
<context-param>
   <param-name>SKIP_ENCODED_CHAR_VERIFICATION</param-name>
   <param-value>true</param-value>
</context-param>
```
>Or set the metatype in the server.xml to skip the verification (4-7) for all deployed application

```<webContainer skipEncodedCharVerification=“true”/>```

>If both are set, application setting takes precedence over server setting.


>**3. X-Powered-By response header**
The `X-Powered-By` header is not included in the response header.  There is no configure option to change the behavior starting in Servlet 6.0

### Deprecations
```
The following APIs are deprecated in Servlet 6.0 (to align with new RFC 6265)

jakarta.servlet.http.Cookie.getComment()
jakarta.servlet.http.Cookie.getVersion()
jakarta.servlet.http.Cookie.setComment(String)
jakarta.servlet.http.Cookie.setVersion(int)
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet.LEGACY_DO_HEAD
jakarta.servlet.SessionCookieConfig.getComment()
jakarta.servlet.SessionCookieConfig.setComment(String)
```

### Removals
```
The following has been previously deprecated and now completely removed in the Servlet 6.0 specification:

jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSessionContext - class
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpUtils – class
jakarta.servlet.SingleThreadModel - class
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest - methods: isRequestedSessionIdFromUrl()
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper - methods: isRequestedSessionIdFromUrl()
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse - methods: encodeUrl, encodeRedirectUrl, setStatus(int, String)
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponseWrapper - methods: encodeUrl(), encodeRedirectUrl,setStatus(int, String)
jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession - methods: getSessionContext(), getValue(), getValueNames(), putValue(),removeValue()
jakarta.servlet.ServletContext – methods: getServlet(), getServlets(), getServletNames(), log(Exception, String)
jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest – methods: getRealPath() //use ServletContext.getRealPath instead
jakarta.servlet.ServletRequestWrapper - methods: getRealPath()
jakarta.servlet.UnavailableException – methods: UnavailableException(Servlet, String),UnavailableException(int, Servlet, String), getServlet()
```

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
    >  Numerous changes have occurred since the last Jakarta Faces release Faces 3.0. The full list of changes can be found link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/faces/4.0/jakarta-faces-4.0.html#changes-between-4-0-and-3-0[here]. Notable changes include Pages (formerly JSP) support has been removed and the Pages feature is no longer enabled with the faces-4.0 feature. Also ManagedBeans support has also been removed and developers should use CDI beans from this version forward. Due to this change, the cdi-4.0 version is now enabled by default with faces-4.0. Some other changes can be grouped as follows:
      

    > - Attributes
    >         - New attribute to support multiple file selection added to h:inputFile tag <h:inputFile multiple="...">
    >         - New attribute to support specific file types added to h:inputFile tag <h:inputFile accept="...">
    >         - New attribute to specify type of input added to h:inputText tag <h:inputText type="..."> 
    >         - New attribute to add specify listener for errors on f:websocket <f:websocket onerror="..."> 
    >         - New list type for layout attribute on <h:selectManyCheckbox layout="list"> and <h:selectOneRadio layout="list"> 
    >         - Type attribute skipped from <link> and <script> when doctype is HTML5
    > - Tags
    >         - New tag <f:selectItemGroups> to create nested collections (i.e., optgroup containing option elements).
    >         - New tag <f:selectItemGroup> to create nested collections
    > - Methods
    >         - New method included in Faces 4.0 UIViewRoot#getDoctype() to identify the declared DOCTYPE of a view added in Faces 4.0
    >         - New method FacesContext#getLifecycle() added for simplicity in Faces 4.0.
    > - Annotations
    >         - New @ClientWindowScoped annotation introduced adding more flexibility than @FlowScoped bean. Starts when a new jfwid request parameter is generated and lives as long as this parameter is reused while navigating across the pages via Faces link components as long as the number of windows opened does not exceed the number of windows specified by the parameter jakarta.faces.NUMBER_OF_CLIENT_WINDOWS. If the number is exceeded, the oldest window gets destroyed to keep the number of windows specified. Default of 10 windows open at a time.
    >         - New annotation literals for @Qualifiers where the developers do not anymore need to manually create AnnotationLiteral instances. With the change to CDI, several API methods take an Annotation as argument representing the desired @Qualifier. These need concrete AnnotationLiteral instances as arguments and this was missing all over Faces API, forcing developers to manually create them. This has now been added on Faces 4.0.
    > - Other changes
    >         - A new API for creating Facelets through pure Java code instead of using XML has been added in this release
    >         - A new context parameter jakarta.faces.AUTOMATIC_EXTENSIONLESS_MAPPING for enabling automatic extensionless mapping has been added as a way to hit Facelets without extensions. If a Facelet in an application could be reached through <context-root>/bar.xhtml, with this parameter now it can be accessed simply via <context-root>/bar.
    >         - New method for added support for custom cookie attributes such as SameSite in ExternalContext#addResponseCookie() allowing custom cookie attributes to be added to a response.
    >         - Renamed “http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/” URIs to “jakarta.faces.” URNs to match the new Jakarta namespace. Backwards compatiblility with the old URIs is still included in Faces 4.0
    >         - Renames accross the code from JSF to Faces in many instances
    >         - Removed MethodBinding, ValueBinding and related classes from Faces Expresion Language extensions.
    >         - Removed deprecated methods of StateManager class, entire ResourceResolver class, CURRENT_COMPONENT constants from UIComponent class.

     > The faces-4.0 feature uses Apache MyFaces, but if a developer wishes to use an alternative Faces implementation, such as Mojarra 4.0, that can be accomplished via the facesContainer-4.0 feature. The Faces API and implementation jars just need to be included in the application WEB-INF/lib folder and the must match the specification version (Faces 4.0 in this case ) which is the only change made for facesContainer-4.0 from facesContainer-3.0.

## Add on top to existing paragraphs.**

Additionally, with the Open Liberty `mpMetrics-5.0` feature, we've introduced the capability for users to bring their own Micrometer libraries for use with the MP metrics runtime. In this new mode of using the `mpMetrics-5.0` feature, users can leverage the Micrometer metrics framework to forward their metric data to monitoring systems supported by the Micrometer registry implementations.  Using this mode of running `mpMetrics-5.0` the user must provide all integrations to monitoring systems that they wish to use. There will be no Prometheus formatted metrics on the `/metrics` REST endpoint unless the Prometheus registry implementation is provided. This alternative mode does not enable Micrometer API usage. Metrics instrumented in your application will still use the MP Metrics API. 

To use this mode of running the `mpMetrics-5.0` feature with Micrometer libraries, you will need to provide the required Micrometer libraries as shared library for the OpenLiberty runtime. These shared libraries will be configured using the `<library>` configuration element in the server.xml. You will then reference the `<library>` element using a `libraryRef` attribute as part of the `<mpMetrics>` server.xml configuration element.

Note this mode of using `mpMetrics-5.0` is an alternative mode of using `mpMetrics-5.0`. If you do not wish to provide Micrometer libraries, you can use the `mpMetrics-5.0` feature normally (as you would have in previous releases) and metrics will be outputted to the `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format. 

Required list of libraries:
1. Micrometer Core library
2. Micrometer Core dependencies
3. Micrometer registry implementation(s)
4. Micrometer registry implementation(s) dependencies

The dependencies can be individually downloaded manually or you can resort to using a `pom.xml` with the dependencies and running the `mvn dependency:copy-dependencies` goal to automatically download the listed artifacts and dependencies for you.

The following server.xml sample shows the `<mpMetrics>` configuration element referencing the `bringYourOwn` shared library element.  The shared library contains the `MicrometerCoreLibs` directory which contains the Micrometer Core library and its dependencies. The second directory, `PrometheusLib`, contains the the Prometheus registry implementation and its dependencies and the last directory contains the InfluxDB registry implementation and its dependencies.

```
    <mpMetrics authentication="true" libraryRef="bringYourOwn"/>
    
    <library id="bringYourOwn">
        <fileset dir="/path/to/MicrometerCoreLibs" includes="*.jar" />
	<fileset dir="/path/to/PrometheusLib" includes="*.jar" />
        <fileset dir="/path/to/InfluxLib" includes="*.jar" />
    </library>
```

The next step is to configure the `mpMetrics` runtime to accept and use the individual registry implementation. This is accomplished by setting a MP Config property `mp.metrics.<registry>.enabled` to true. Note that the property for Prometheus registry (i.e. `mp.metrics.prometheus.enabled` ) defaults to true automatically. The `<registry>` value is determined through the Micrometer documentation for the individual registry implementations.

Continuing from the above server.xml snippet, we would need to enable the property for the InfluxDB registry implementation.

```
 <variable name="mp.metrics.influx.enabled" value="true" />
```

Lastly, you will need to provide any additional configuration properties defined by the Micrometer documentation to properly configure the registry implementation to connect to the associated metric monitoring system. This is accomplished through MP Config properties which follow the format `mp.metrics.<registry>.<property>`.  Note that Prometheus does not require any properties for configuration.

Continuing the sever.xml example, the configuration for the InfluxDB registry would look like:

```
    <variable name="mp.metrics.influx.uri" value="http://localhost:8086" />
    <variable name="mp.metrics.influx.bucket" value="bucketNa,e"/>
    <variable name="mp.metrics.influx.org" value="orgName"/>
    <variable name="mp.metrics.influx.step" value="15s"/>
    <variable name="mp.metrics.influx.token" value="<Influx_Token_value>" />
```

Now start your server and you will now have metrics outputted to the `/metrics` REST endpoint with Prometheus formatted metrics and metric data will be sent to a InfluxDB deployment.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

> The following links show the change history of the Specification between the Expression Language 4.0 and Expression Language 5.0: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/expression-language/5.0/jakarta-expression-language-spec-5.0.html#changes-between-5-0-and-4-0. Some of these new features are:

> 
> - The addition of the link:https://jakarta.ee/specifications/expression-language/5.0/apidocs/jakarta.el/jakarta/el/methodreference[MethodReference] which "Provides information about the method to which a method expression resolves." This new class allows developers to access any annotations present on a particular method using the getAnnotations() method. 
> - New generics were added where appropriate throughout the Expression Language 5.0 API. Before developers would have to manually cast their API calls to the appropriate object but now with generics this is no longer necessary. 
> - New coercion of Arrays and Lambda expressions allowing developers the ability to use more data types in their applications.
> - There is also one deprecation, a few clarifications, and fixes within the Expression Language 5.0 Specification.

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

   Application developers

   </GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>

   <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] is a set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. This feature adopts OpenTelemetry from CNCF to allow MicroProfile Applications to benefit from OpenTelemetry and enable automatic tracing of Jakarta RESTful Web Services if configured.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   
Microservice architecture can make it more difficult to see how services depend on or affect other services, which also makes it harder to find the source of latency or inaccuracy. MicroProfile Telemetry helps you collect data on the paths that application requests take through services.

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

`server.xml` snippet.

```xml
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpTelemetry-1.0</feature>
</featureManager>
```

Additionally, third-party APIs must be made visible for your application in the server.xml:

```xml
<webApplication location="demo-microprofile-telemetry-inventory.war" contextRoot="/">
    <!-- enable visibility to third party apis -->
    <classloader apiTypeVisibility="+third-party"/>
</webApplication>
```xml

MicroProfile Telemetry can then create automatic traces for your application. You can also modify your source code to get further spans. For example: 

```java
    @Inject
    Tracer tracer;

    private void doWork() {
        Span workSpan = tracer.spanBuilder("workSpan").startSpan();
        try (Scope scope = workSpan.makeCurrent()) {
           ...
        } finally {
            span.end();
        }
    }
```

You can view the telemetry data from your application in Jaeger(https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.37/monitoring/#traces)  and Zipkin(https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart.html) or export your traces to logs using the included logging exporter. To export your traces to one of these exporters, link:https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure/README.md#exporters[configure the exporter] with system properties, e.g. `-Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp` or environment variables, e.g. `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp`.  You can also configure the exporter endpoints using `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT`.

   Short feature name (eg websockets-1.0): `persistence-3.1, persistenceContainer-3.1`

   
   </GHA-BLOG-RELATED-FEATURES>

   <GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>
3. Who is the target persona? Who do you expect to use the update? eg application developer, operations.
    
   The target audience are Jakarta EE developers who want to use JPA to mediate Database interactions.
   </GHA-BLOG-TARGET-PERSONA>

   <GHA-BLOG-SUMMARY>
4. Provide a summary of the update, including the following points:
   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
`Jakarta Persistence API is a richly featured API which provides object-model approach to persisting, fetching, and modifying data stored on a Relational Database System`

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
   `JPA was first introduced in EE 5, but before JPA you had to use EJB's Bean or Container managed entities, or raw JDBC to interact with database storage.`

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
```
To enable Jakarta Persistence 3.1, simply add the "persistence-3.1" entry to the "featureManager" element list, 
this will enable JPA 3.1 runtime integration as well as the provided JPA 3.1 compliant persistence implementation, 
Eclipselink 4.0.  Users who wish to bring their own third party JPA persistence provider (like Hibernate) should use 
the "persistenceContainer-3.1" feature instead, which will enable the JPA 3.1 runtime integration, but will not 
activate the provided Eclipselink implementation.

Jakarta persistence 3.1 provides a number of new features, including the support for java.util.UUID with JPA entity identity fields
(and support for automatic key generation with UUID types), the addition of a host of numeric operators (such as CEILING, EXP, 
FLOOR, LN, POWER, ROUND, and SIGN) and temporal functions (LOCAL DATE, LOCAL DATETIME, and LOCAL TIME) for Jakarta
Persistence Query Language (JPQL) and Criteria API, as well as an EXTRACT function for JPQL.  EntityManagerFactory and
EntityManager have been updated to be AutoClosable, which allows their use in try-with-resources blocks.  The JPA 3.1 
specification also includes a host of clarifications for the JPQL BNF, the @Basic annotation, and 
SqlResultSetMapping.
```
   
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?
More information about the Jakarta Persistence 3.1 specification can be found at its home page at https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/3.1/.  More information about the Eclipselink 4.0 that is provided with the persistence-3.1 feature can be found at https://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/.

A passivated (i.e. serializable) bean which has an injected jakarta.enterprise.event.Event (or javax equivalent) will not be properly restored.  This can be encountered when session persistence is enabled and session data is serialized and de-serialized from a database.
