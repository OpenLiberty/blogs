== Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile, Web Profile, and Platform
Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile, Web Profile and Platform are now officially supported in Open Liberty! We'd like to start by thanking all those who provided feedback throughout our various betas.

Jakarta EE 10 marks a major milestone. It is the first Jakarta release to provide updates to the specifications since Java EE 8 in 2017 and, therefore, the first to provide spec updates since the spec was taken over by the Eclipse Foundation. Among the many updates to existing specifications, it also introduces the Core Profile. The Core Profile is aimed at lightweight runtimes, like Open Liberty, that are optimized for running cloud-native Java microservices.

The following specifications make up the Jakarta Platform and the Core and Web profiles:

Liberty provides convenience features for running all of the component specifications that are contained in the Jakarta EE 10 Web Profile (`link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/webProfile-10.0.html[webProfile-10.0]`) and Jakarta EE 10 Platform (`link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/jakartaee-10.0.html[jakartaee-10.0]`). These convenience features enable you to rapidly develop applications using all of the APIs contained in their respective specifications. For Jakarta EE 10 features in the application client, use the `link:{url-prefix}/docs/latest/reference/feature/jakartaeeClient-10.0.html[jakartaeeClient-10.0]` Liberty feature.

To enable the Jakarta EE Platform 10 features, add the `jakartaee-10.0` feature to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jakartaee-10.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

Alternatively, to enable the Jakarta EE Web Profile 10 features, add the `webProfile-10.0` feature to your `server.xml` file:


[source,xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>webProfile-10.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

Although no convenience feature exists for the Core Profile, you can enable its equivalent by adding the following features to your `server.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jsonb-3.0</feature>
    <feature>jsonp-2.1</feature>
    <feature>cdi-4.0</feature>
    <feature>restfulWS-3.1</feature>
  </featureManager>
----

To run Jakarta EE 10 features on the Application Client Container, add the following entry in your application's `client.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
  <featureManager>
    <feature>jakartaeeClient-10.0</feature>
  </featureManager>
----
