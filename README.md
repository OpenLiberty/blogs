# Contributing to the blogs



1. Create an issue for your blog post in this repository.
2. Fork this repository and clone.
3. Creating/Updating blog content:
   * For a new blog post, create a new file in the [posts](./posts) directory with the post title as the file name and a `.adoc` extension, and write your post.
      * Update the [blogs_tags.json](./blog_tags.json) by adding your blog post to the start of the `posts` array (1-2 entries per line) for each appropriate tag.
   * For an existing blog post, simply make the change to the existing blog post file in the [posts](./posts) directory.
      * If necessary, update the [blogs_tags.json](./blog_tags.json) by adding/removing the blog from the `posts` arrays (add to beginning, 1-2 entries per line) of the tags.
   * Any images that you want to reference in your blog post must be placed in [img/blog](./img/blog/) directory.
   * For more information regarding creating/editing blog post content (like multiple authors, third-party posts, etc), refer to documentation that follows this section.
4. Once finished and verified locally (adoc editor, or ol.io blog docker image) create a pull request into the `draft` branch (linked to the issue you created in Step 1) with @lauracowen (or another admin in her absence) and anyone else as reviewer.
5. Request a build of the draft site:
    1. Go to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/github/OpenLiberty/openliberty.io)
    2. More Options > Trigger Build > Make sure the `master` branch is selected (default) > Trigger custom build
6. Once the build completes, check to make sure the blog renders correctly on the [draft site](https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/blog/) and resolve any problems (like formatting/styling).
7. Create a PR into `staging` branch renaming the file to `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.adoc`, provide a link to your post on the [draft site](https://draft-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/blog/) and add @lauracowen, SMEs, and/or other reviewers to get their final approval for both content and format.  Once approved, @lauracowen or another 'admin' will merge the PR into `staging` and shepherd the post through the remaining steps.  Note that since there's likely other 'draft' blog posts that have been committed, this will be either a cherry pick of the necesary commits, or a PR from the personal branch that has been, if necessary, updated to match the post content on the `draft` branch.
8. Request a build of the staging site (same as step 5)
    1. Go to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/github/OpenLiberty/openliberty.io)
    2. More Options > Trigger Build > Make sure the `master` branch is selected (default) > Trigger custom build
9. Once the build completes, check to make sure the blog renders correctly on the [staging site](https://staging-openlibertyio.mybluemix.net/blog/).  This is the final check before the post goes into the production site.
10. If there are issues found on the staging site, they must be resolved quickly, either by updating the PR with a fix, or reverting it.  If you updated the PR with a fix, make sure it also gets updated in the `draft` branch.
11. Rebuild the production site on IBM Cloud and verify the post looks as expected on openliberty.io

Summary of branch flow:  
`prod` <-PR- `staging` <-PR- `draft` <-PR- `personal branch from fork`  
In other words, `prod` should always be a commit subset of `staging` which should be a commit subset of `draft`  
  
  
### Blog structure (AsciiDoc & front matter)
Blogs are written in [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/) format with a file extension of `.adoc`.

In the blog post file the following front matter variables must be set:
- layout: post
- title: `title of the blog post`
- categories: blog
- author_picture: `secure url to author picture`
     - If a picture cannot be found, the openliberty.io logo can be used instead https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/28316667
- author_github: `secure url to author github`
- blog_description: `Description of blog post used in the preview card on openliberty.io/blog`
     - Please keep your `blog_description` to around 60 words
- seo-title: `Blog Title used in search results and on social media - OpenLiberty.io`
     - Please ensure that your `seo-title` ends with ` - OpenLiberty.io`
- seo-description: `Blog Description used in search results and on social media`
     - Please keep your `seo-description` between 50-300 characters


### Blog posts with multiple authors

If you would like to publish a blog post with more than 1 author, you can add the ```additional_authors``` attribute to the liquid front matter. Any number of additional authors can be specified using the following format:
```
additional_authors: 
 - name: author 2 first and last name
   github: secure url to author 2 github
   image: secure url to author 2 picture
 - name:  author 3 first and last name
   github: secure url to author 3 github
   image: secure url to author 3 picture
```

### Contributing a third party blog post

If you would like to add a blog post that is actually a link to an existing third party blog post, you can follow the normal steps described above for creating a blog post. You simply need to add the following attributes to the liquid front matter: 
- redirect_link: secure_url_to_3rd_party_post
- permalink: /blog/redirected.html

Also provide a level 1 heading eg:

`= Creating a cool app with MicroProfile`

### Troubleshooting

Certain characters (eg apostrophe ' ) in the main heading are displayed incorrectly. To fix, escape with a backslash (`\`).
eg `= Minimise turnaround times with Open Liberty\'s dev mode`

# Docker container for development

Github.com does a pretty good job of rendering asciidoc so you can preview your file there, but to see exactly what it will
look like you'll need to install the website software and run it. 

### Running the website on your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenLiberty/blogs.git
git clone https://github.com/OpenLiberty/openliberty.io.git
docker pull kinueng/openliberty.io
```
Replace "currentFolder" in the following command with the full path to the folder you are in. 
```
docker run --rm --name website -it -p 4000:4000 -v currentFolder/openliberty.io:/home/jekyll kinueng/openliberty.io

# example when current directory is /Users/bruce/projects/blog/website:
# docker run --name website -it -p 4000:4000 -v /Users/bruce/projects/blog/website/openliberty.io:/home/jekyll kinueng/openliberty.io
```

### Update the running container with your edits
Before your new or updated blog entry will appear on the website, you will need to run the script below to update the container with your latest changes, then wait for the container to finish processing them.  Then you can see your changes at http://localhost:4000/blog/

Note that blogs named with dates in the future, e.g. 2099-01-05, will not be shown, so don't do that. 

```
./blogs/scripts/refresh_docker_image.sh
```

### How to know when your changes are rendered by the container
You will see `Jekyll` detect your new files and regenerate the blog files.  You will want to wait for the line "...done in XXXX seconds."

```
      Regenerating: 101 file(s) changed at 2018-10-29 18:53:10
      ...
      Jekyll Feed: Generating feed for posts
      ...
            ...done in 121.8705398 seconds.
```
