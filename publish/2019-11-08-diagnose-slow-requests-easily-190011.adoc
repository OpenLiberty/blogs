= Diagnose slow requests more easily with improved request logging in Open Liberty 19.0.0.11
Tom Jennings <https://github.com/tomjenningss>


Open Liberty 19.0.0.11 provides a useful option to automatically detect slow requests and logs the information when the request is complete through the Request Timing 1.0 feature.

Give it a try in link:/about/[Open Liberty] 19.0.0.11.

If you're interested in what's coming soon in Open Liberty, take a look at our <<previews,current development builds>>. In particular, get an early insight into Jaeger support for MicroProfile OpenTracing, and performance improvements through annotation caching.

== Diagnose slow requests more easily with improved request logging (Request Timing 1.0)

The feature provides a way of monitoring requests with respect to time. In particular, the feature will automatically detect slow and hung requests all while routing the information back to users to assist with diagnosing the cause of the slow or hung requests.

Previously, the feature would only log that a slow request was detected and never log when the slow request completed. Now users will be able to view information about a slow request that completed with the request id and the amount of time it took for the request to complete.

This upgrade to the Request Timing feature, although simple, will be extremly helpful when it comes to diagnosing requests that are detected to be slow. Users will now have a simple way of verifying that a slow request actually completed and also how long it took for the slow request to complete. This additional information will make the monitoring of slow requests more efficient and enable users to determine if a slow request completed or not.

To enable the feature add it to the `server.xml`

The detection of slow or hung requests is done automatically. The logging of information when a slow request completes is also done automatically. To enable the feature simple include requestTiming-1.0 in the server.xml. You may also alter default parameters associated with the feature as descibed here https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/request-timing-diagnosing-slow-requests-liberty/ in the Configuring slow and hung request detection section.

[#hc21]
== Provide your own health check procedures (MicroProfile Health Check 2.1)

MicroProfile Health Check 2.1 enables you to provide your own health check procedures to be invoked by Liberty, to verify the health of your microservice.

[source,java]
----
HealthCheckResponse.up("myCheck");
----

In previous versions, to define a simple successful/failed named health check response, the application level code is always expected to use several static methods together from the HealthCheckResponse API, to retrieve a HealthCheckResponseBuilder used to construct a HealthCheck response.

In `mpHealth-2.1` feature for Open Liberty, you can now use convenient and simpler methods from standard Java APIs, to construct UP/DOWN named health check responses, in your applications, such as;

`HealthCheckResponse.named(“myCheck”).up().build();`

To make it work include the following in the `server.xml` file:

[source, xml]
----
<feature>mpHealth-2.1</feature>
----

Applications are expected to provide health check procedures, by implementing the HealthCheck interface with the `@Liveness` or `@Readiness` annotations, which will be used by Liberty to verify the Liveness or Readiness of the application, respectively. Add the logic of your health check in the `call()` method, and return the HealthCheckResponse object, by constructing using the simple `up()`/`down()` methods from the API. To view the status of each health check, access the either the `+http://<hostname>:<port>/health/live+` or `+http://<hostname>:<port>/health/ready+` endpoints.

[source, java]
----
**Liveness Check**
@Liveness
@ApplicationScoped
public class AppLiveCheck implements HealthCheck {
...
    @Override
     public HealthCheckResponse call() {
       ...
       HealthCheckResponse.up("myCheck");
       ...
     }
}
----

[#hm21]
== Monitor microservice applications easily wth (MicroProfile Metrics 2.1) 

MicroProfile Metrics 2.1 allows you to instrument metrics in microservice applications for easy monitoring. Previously, the Gauge metric was intended to sample numerical values only, but users could sample non-numeric values (such as String). MicroProfile Metrics 2.1 restricts the scope such that Gauge can only sample numbers now.

Previously, the MetadataBuilder API had `reusable()` and `notReusable()` method to set the reusable field to true or false. The MetadataBuilder API has been changed to include a new setter method for the reusable attribute. This change is implemented so the MetadataBuilder API follows the builder pattern.

To enable the feature in the `server.xml` file:
[source, xml]
----
<feature>mpMetrics-2.1</feature>
----

The following is an example of how to set the reusable field with the MetadataBuilder API:
[source, java]
----
MetadataBuilder mdb = Metadata.builder();
----

[source, java]
----
mdb = mdb.withName("metricName").withType(MetricType.COUNTER)
  .reusable(resolveIsReusable());
----
[#JMO]
== Jaeger support added for tracing (MicroProfile OpenTracing 1.3)

Open Liberty has added support for Jaeger in MicroProfile OpenTracing. A sample tracer is available link:https://github.com/WASdev/sample.opentracing.zipkintracer[here] for using Zipkin as a tracing backend. With the addition of Jaeger support, developers can also use Jaeger as a tracing backend.

You can download the Jaeger client version 0.34.0 library and its dependencies from link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.jaegertracing/jaeger-client/0.34.0[Maven repository].

In the `server.xml:` 

Add `<feature>mpOpenTracing-1.3</feature>` under `<featureManager>` section.

[source, xml]
----
    <library id="jaegerLib" apiTypeVisibility="+third-party" >
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/gson-2.8.2.jar" />
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/jaeger-client-0.34.0.jar" />
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/jaeger-core-0.34.0.jar" />
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/jaeger-thrift-0.34.0.jar" />
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/jaeger-tracerresolver-0.34.0.jar" />
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/libthrift-0.12.0.jar" />
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar" />
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/slf4j-jdk14-1.7.25.jar" />
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/opentracing-util-0.31.0.jar" />
        <file name="<path>/jaegerLib_0.34/opentracing-noop-0.31.0.jar" />
    </library>
----

Define your appplication:

[source, xml]

  <webApplication location="yourapp.war" contextRoot="/yourapp">
        <!-- enable visibility to third party apis -->
        <classloader commonLibraryRef="jaegerLib"
            apiTypeVisibility="+third-party" />
  </webApplication>

You can find out more about about Jaeger settings set up using environment variables by looking at link:https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java/blob/10c641f8df6316f1eac4d5b1715513275bcd724e/jaeger-core/README.md[jaeger-client-java readme.] 

** For the `JAEGER_PASSWORD` environment variable, the password can be encoded using the `securityUtility command.`
** Depending on Jaeger's sampling settings `JAEGER_SAMPLER_TYPE` and `JAEGER_SAMPLER_PARAM`, Jaeger may not report every spans created by the applications.

[#LAC]
== Faster app startup with Liberty annotation caching
During application startup, application classes are scanned for class signature information and for annotations. Typically, all application classes are scanned, which is time consuming.

For early access, annotation caching is enabled when the product edition is `EARLY_ACCESS`. For other product editions, annotation caching is disabled, but may be forced on by setting Java custom property `anno.beta` to `true`. When the product edition is `EARLY_ACCESS`, the caching function may be forced off by setting ava custom property `anno.beta` to `false`.
The new scan engine may be enabled with cache function turned off by setting Java custom property `anno.cache.disabled` to `true`. The new scan engine may be prevented from writing new data by setting Java custom property `anno.cache.readOnly` to `true`.  Already generated cache data will still be read.  This may be necessary in
certain deployment pipelines. When enabled, application class scan steps automatically write cache scan data, and automatically read cachedscan data.  Cache data is automatically regenerated when changes are detected in application classes.  No additional settings are necessary to use the new function, unless you are a pipeline developer see important note below.

Cache data is visible as a new, nested directory of server workarea named `anno`.  Cache data uses a binary
format and is not human readable. Cache data is relocatable: Movement of a server image to a new location
does not require that the application class scan cache data be regenerated.
The cache of application class data is cleared when performing a clean server start (starting the server with
the `--clean` option).  In normal operations, the clearing of cache data is not necessary, since the cache 
automatically detects class changes and regenerates invalid cache data.  However, the cache function has no
way to tell when cache data is obsolete.  If the same server is used with many different applications, a clean
start should be performed occasionally to remove stale cache data.


In a pipeline deployment environment, for caching to be effective, the server image must be
"warmed" before packaging the deployment image, and application class cache data must be included in the
deployment image. Warming the server means performing a single start of the server.  This causes cache data to be generated and available when packaging the server image.  A failure to generate the cache
data or to include the cache data in the deployment image prevents the server deployment from obtaining the full value of the new caching function.

The following chart shows changes to server startup times comparing server startups which do not use the new caching function with server startups that use the the new caching function:  

image::img/blog/190011-annotationcaching-graph.png[align="center"]

Startups which use new caching function have cache data already generated.
The case `huge-ejb` is an atypical case: An application that has 500 EJB jars, where each jar has four classes.
Generally, performance improvements are larger for larger applications, and for applications which use CDI or
WebService functionality.

[#GraphQL]
== You are now free to use GraphQL with Open Liberty! 
In our latest OpenLiberty development builds, users can now develop and deploy GraphQL applications.  GraphQL is a complement/alternative to REST that allows clients to fetch or modify remote data, but with fewer round-trips.  Liberty now supports the (still under development) MicroProfile GraphQL APIs (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-graphql[learn more]) that allow developers to create GraphQL apps using simple annotations - similar to how JAX-RS uses annotations to create a RESTful app.

Developing and deploying a GraphQL app is cinch - take a look at this https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-mp-graphql[sample] to get started with these powerful APIs!
