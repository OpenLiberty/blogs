= What's new with REST in Liberty 18.0.0.4?

It's been a few months since you heard from us, so we wanted to check in and let
you know about a few things we've been working on.

First, let's take a look back at what we've done earlier this year.  Over the
summer, we shipped JAX-RS 2.1 in Liberty 18.0.0.2.  This adds powerful new
features like the Reactive Client, Server Sent Events, and more.  If you missed
it, check out our previous https://openliberty.io/blog/2018/06/29/full_java_ee_8_liberty_18002.html#jaxrs[blog post].

In September, we delivered the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client/releases/tag/1.1[MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1]
in Liberty 18.0.0.3.  This adds asynchronous methods, URI support, better
integration with CDI and a RestClientBuilderListener for third-party libraries
to integrate with client instances.

While our upcoming 18.0.0.4 release won't have any blockbuster spec
implementations, we have still been hard at work.  Here are some of the things
we've been working on:

== New async transport layer

We integrated the Apache HTTP Client transport layer from the CXF project. This
improves asynchronous method invocations - in some performance benchmarks, we
measured a 20-25% improvement in throughput (your mileage may vary).

== Connection pooling enhancements

The JAX-RS client has had HTTP connection pooling for a while, but HTTPS
connections were not being pooled.  As more and more services require HTTPS
(this is a good thing!), it can be a burden for systems to construct, tear down
and reconstruct connections to the same endpoint.  Starting with Liberty
18.0.0.4, HTTPS connections are now pooled.

== Reactive Extensions

JAX-RS 2.1 introduced the reactive client, but the spec only requires vendors to
implement it using Java 8's `CompletionStage` API.  Other reactive frameworks
can integrate with the reactive client, but that is optional in the spec.  With
Liberty 18.0.0.4, it is now possible to use these extensions.  We've tested with
RxJava 1 and 2 using providers from http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-basics.html#JAX-RSBasics-ReactiveClientAPI[Apache CXF]
and https://jersey.github.io/project-info/2.27/jersey/project/project/jersey-rx-client-rxjava2/dependencies.html[Jersey],
and we plan to test more - if there is a particular reactive technology that
you would like to use - and it has a JAX-RS `RxInvokerProvider` implementation,
please let us know!

== Properties handling in the MicroProfile Rest Client

The `RestClientBuilder` and MP Config allows users to specify custom properties
to the Rest Client instance.  Now, you can use JAX-RS Client properties, such
as:

* `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.keepalive.connection` - which you can set to "close" to prevent keeping connections alive for multiple requests.
* `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.connection.timeout` - milliseconds to wait for the
HTTP connection to be established before timing out.
* `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.receive.timeout` - milliseconds to wait for a
response from the remote service once the connection has been established.
* `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.proxy.host` - hostname of the proxy server to use
for requests from this client instance.
* `com.ibm.ws.jaxrs.client.proxy.port` - port number of the proxy server to use
for requests from this client instance.

== Other bug fixes and minor enhancements

We're constantly trying to improve the JAX-RS and MicroProfile Rest Client
implementation.  Sometimes we find things to fix on our own, and sometimes our
customers help us find bugs to fix.  If you discover a bug or can think of
something that we can do in the product to make it better, please let us know!
The best way is probably to open an https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues[issue]
in GitHub, but you can also talk with us on the Open Liberty https://groups.io/g/openliberty[mail list].

Thanks for checking in with us; we hope you enjoy our 18.0.0.4 release!
