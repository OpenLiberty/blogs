= Get alerts from your Open Liberty apps in Slack using Prometheus Alertmanager in RHOCP 4.3

We had good reception for our link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2020/01/29/alerts-slack-prometheus-alertmanager-open-liberty.html[original blog post] for setting up Prometheus Alertmanager, so we're publishing a version that'll set you up on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform too.

Every application needs a strong monitoring system to catch unexpected issues, whether it's an overloaded heap or a slow-responding servlet. link:https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-metrics.html[MicroProfile Metrics] provides the ability to expose metrics for your application. Used in conjunction with the open source monitoring system link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] and the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/overview/[Prometheus Alertmanager], we can build a strong foundation for monitoring your system and reacting quickly to issues.

In this post, we'll set up Prometheus Alertmanager on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.3 using the Prometheus Operator. The Alertmanager will fire alerts to a specified Slack channel to notify you when, for example, your app's heap usage is too high. We'll configure Prometheus with alerting rules to receive certain alerts from Open Liberty, then we'll configure Prometheus Alertmanager to pass those alerts to a Slack channel.

Already familiar with Alertmanager? Check out link:https://github.com/jennifer-c/openliberty-alertmanager[some sample rules for Open Liberty]. The repository also contains the configuration files used as an example in this blog post, if you get stuck along the way.

== What you'll need

You will need an RHOCP 4.3 cluster. You can try it on other versions, but this blog was written on and tested with 4.3.

Before we start, make sure your app is configured with an Open Liberty server with the `mpMetrics-2.0` feature enabled. Ensure that it is deployed on an RHOCP cluster and the `/metrics` endpoint is available.

You also need a Slack channel to send alerts to, as well as a link:https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks[Slack webhook] for that channel.

== Configure Prometheus to monitor metrics from Open Liberty on RHOCP 4.3

Follow the link:https://kabanero.io/guides/app-monitoring-ocp4.2/#deploy-prometheus-prometheus-operator[guide on kabanero.io] to set up Prometheus using the Prometheus Operator.

You only need to follow the guide to Step 11; however, it is recommended to deploy Grafana to have a visualization of your metrics.

=== Creating Prometheus alerting rules

Create a new Prometheus Rule instance in the Prometheus Operator to create some alerting rules in Prometheus to define which metrics will be received by the Alertmanager.

. Go to the OpenShift Container Platform web console and click on Operators > Installed Operators > Prometheus Operator > Prometheus Rule.
. Create a new PrometheusRule instance. Under `spec.groups`, add a new rule group called `libertyexample` to the YAML:
+
```
spec:
  groups:
    - name: ./example.rules
      rules:
        - alert: ExampleAlert
          expr: vector(1)
    - name: libertyexample
      rules:
      - alert: heapUsageTooHigh
        expr: base_memory_usedHeap_bytes / base_memory_maxHeap_bytes > 0.9
        for: 1m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Heap usage is too high"
          description: "{{ $labels.instance }} heap usage is too high"
```
+
This rule will send an alert called `heapUsageTooHigh` when the PromQL query `base_memory_usedHeap_bytes / base_memory_maxHeap_bytes` is greater than `0.9` (90%) for one minute. (For testing purposes, feel free to change the threshold to something smaller, like `0.05`.)
+
If you're new to PromQL, check out link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/[Querying Prometheus].
+
Note that there's a rule group with the name `./example.rules` created by default. This is a rule that always fires an alert, so you can keep this for now to test your configuration.
+
. Change the labels to match the `ruleSelector` in your Prometheus. For example, if you used the `prometheus.yaml` in the Kabanero guide, your Prometheus YAML would contain:
+
```
ruleSelector:
    matchLabels:
      prometheus: k8s
      role: prometheus-rulefiles
```
+
So your PrometheusRule labels must also match:
+
```
labels:
    prometheus: k8s
    role: prometheus-rulefiles
```
+
. Navigate to your Prometheus route and click on Status > Rules to verify that they've been loaded in properly.
+

+
. To check that your alerts are firing, click on Alerts. Since we did not remove the `./example.rules` rule group, you should already see at least one alert firing. To ensure that your custom Liberty rules are also working, generate some data or drastically lower the threshold of the PromQL query.

== Create and configure Prometheus Alertmanager to pass alerts to Slack

In this section, you'll create and configure the Prometheus Alertmanager to send customized messages to your Slack channel based on the alerting rules we set up earlier.

=== Creating and configuring the Prometheus Alertmanager to communicate with Slack

Now that Prometheus is set up with rules for our Liberty server, we can create a Prometheus Alertmanager instance with the ability to connect to Slack.

. Create a file named `alertmanager.yaml` (do not change the name) - take note of the directory, as we will be creating a secret using this file. Note that this file is configured the same way as we did in the previous blog post. We'll start with a simple configuration. Your file will look like this:
+
```
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m
  slack_api_url: <your slack webhook api url>

# The root route. This route is used as the default
# if there are no matches in the child routes.
route:
  group_by: [ alertname ]
  group_wait: 10s
  group_interval: 10s
  repeat_interval: 5m
  receiver: 'default_receiver'

receivers:
- name: 'default_receiver'
  slack_configs:
  - channel: 'prometheus-alertmanager-test'
    title: "{{ range .Alerts }}{{ .Annotations.summary }}\n{{ end }}"
    text: "*Description*: {{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}\n*Severity*: {{ .CommonLabels.severity }}"
```
+
In this example, we have one route that sends the alert to `default_receiver`. The receiver sends the alert to a Slack channel called `prometheus-alertmanager-test`.
The `CommonAnnotations` come from the `annotations` you specified in your Prometheus Rule. The text is written using the link:https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[Go templating] system.
+
. On the RHOCP web console, go to Operators > Installed Operators > Prometheus Operator > Alertmanager and create a new Alertmanager instance. You do not need to change the default YAML.
. Create a secret with your `alertmanager.yaml` file with the name of your alertmanager, prefixed by `alertmanager`:
+
```
❯ oc create secret generic alertmanager-alertmanager-main --from-file=alertmanager.yaml
secret/alertmanager-alertmanager-main created
```
+
In this example, the name of our secret is `alertmanager-alertmanager-main` because our Alertmanager name is `alertmanager-main`, so we prefix the secret name with `alertmanager`.
+
. Check that the service has started successfully.
+
```
❯ oc get svc -n prometheus-operator
NAME                    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
alertmanager-operated   ClusterIP   None         <none>        9093/TCP,9094/TCP,9094/UDP   18m
prometheus-operated     ClusterIP   None         <none>        9090/TCP                     64m
```
+
. Once your pods are up and running, expose the route:
+
```
❯ oc expose svc/alertmanager-operated -n prometheus-operator
route.route.openshift.io/alertmanager-operated exposed
❯ oc get route -n prometheus-operator
NAME                    HOST/PORT                                                                  PATH   SERVICES                PORT   TERMINATION   WILDCARD
alertmanager-operated   alertmanager-operated-prometheus-operator.apps.jenniferc.os.fyre.ibm.com          alertmanager-operated   web                  None
prometheus-operated     prometheus-operated-prometheus-operator.apps.jenniferc.os.fyre.ibm.com            prometheus-operated     web                  None
```

You can now access the Alertmanager UI. Since we haven't configured Prometheus to send the Alertmanager any alerts yet, you won't see any alert groups at the moment. We'll do that next.

=== Receiving alerts via Prometheus Alertmanager
Now that the Alertmanager is set up, we need to configure Prometheus to talk to it.

. First, we'll need to expose the Alertmanager port. On the RHOCP web console, click on Networking > Services > Create Service. Create a ClusterIP service:
+
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: alertmanager-example-service
  namespace: prometheus-operator
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - name: web
    port: 9093
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: web
  selector:
    alertmanager: alertmanager-main
```
+
The `selector.alertmanager` must match your Alertmanager's name, if you changed it from the default value.
+

. On the RHOCP web console, click on Operators > Installed Operators > Prometheus Operator > Prometheus, then click on the name of your Prometheus instance.
. In the YAML, add your new service to the `alertmanagers` for Prometheus to talk to.
+
```
spec:
  alerting:
    alertmanagers:
      - name: alertmanager-example-service
        namespace: alertmanager
        port: web
```
+
. Go to your Prometheus route, then click on Alerts. Ensure that at least one alert is firing.
. Verify that Alertmanager has received the alert by going to the Alertmanager route.
+

+
. Check your Slack channel to see your message.

For more advanced configurations, check out the link:/blog/2020/01/29/alerts-slack-prometheus-alertmanager-open-liberty.html#tips[additional tips for when you’re creating larger alerting systems] in the original blog post. To load in new rules, you can edit your Prometheus Rule instance's YAML from the web console, under Operators > Installed Operators > Prometheus Operator > Prometheus Rule. Similarly, to update your Alertmanager configuration, simply edit your `alertmanager.yaml` and re-create the secret.
