= Asynchronous REST with JAX-RS and MicroProfile

JAX-RS and MicroProfile Rest Client make writing and consuming RESTful services
both easy and powerful, especially when using their asynchronous capabilities.
In this post, we'll look at how to use asynchronous JAX-RS resource methods on
the server side. There are limited use cases in which async is suitable on the
server, so we'll try to cover those cases where it is most useful. Async on the
client can be very beneficial.  We'll cover the advantages, and we'll also go
over the different ways of implementing an asynchronous client including the
JAX-RS 2.0 async APIs, the JAX-RS 2.1 reactive APIs, and the MicroProfile Rest
Client 1.1 type-safe, async APIs.

We'll follow a sample travel planning service at:
https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-async-rest

The application makes RESTful calls to an airline service, hotel service, and
car rental service in order to make reservations and determine the total cost of
the trip.



== Async on the server (JAX-RS 2.0 and 2.1)

A JAX-RS resource method can be made asynchronous by using the `@Suspended`
annotation on a parameter of type, `AsyncResponse`. Usually, the resource method
would return `void` since the actual response would be returned using the
`AsyncResponse.resume(Object)` method. Here is an example:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/airline")
public class AirlineService {

    private static ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);

    @Path("/cost")
    @GET
    public void getReservation(@QueryParam("from") String from,
                               @QueryParam("to") String to,
                               @QueryParam("start") LocalDate start,
                               @QueryParam("end") LocalDate end,
                               @Suspended AsyncResponse ar) {

        executor.execute( () -> {
            Reservation r = new Reservation();
            r.setDestination(to);
            r.setInitialLocation(from);
            r.setStartDate(start);
            r.setReturnDate(end);
            r.setCost(DBHelper.getCostOfAirlineReservation(from, to, start, end));

            ar.resume(r);
        });

    }
}
----

So what does this actually do? First, notice that there is a fixed thread pool,
limited to 10 threads (this is for simplicity - a better practice would be to
make the thread pool size configurable with
https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config.html[MicroProfile Config]
so that you could change this setting without recompiling). We might choose to
limit the size of the thread pool to prevent overloading the back-end resource,
a database in this case.

Next, notice that the `getReservation` resource method doesn't actually return
anything. Instead it creates a new `Reservation` in a `Runnable` (via lambda)
that makes a database call and then returns the reservation to the client
through the `AsyncResponse` object. This means that the thread invoking the
`getReservation` method can return immediately to handle new requests. The
client won't see a response, however, until the call to the `Reservation` has
been constructed and passed to the `resume` method, which might take a little
while depending on how long the database request might take (`DBHelper...`).
This example is essentially throttling access to the database.

Let's suppose that the database is running slowly for some reason. If we
implement this method synchronously, we might run into a situation where the
database starts rejecting work, leading to exceptions thrown back to the client.
By implementing this asynchronously, we limit the connections to 10; additional
requests would be queued until they could eventually be executed by the executor
service. This is ideal so long as the database can eventually catch up with the
work.

In practice, it is my opinion that there are relatively few use cases where
asynchronous methods on the server are more effective than their synchronous
counterparts. Throttling access to another resource (as above) is one use case.
Others might include where the thread factory has created threads optimized for
the response (i.e. they already contain data on a ThreadLocal). Perhaps there is
a performance benefit on some application servers;
https://www.openliberty.io[Open Liberty] uses a
https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/was-liberty-threading-and-why-you-probably-dont-need-to-tune-it/[well-tuned, global thread pool],
there aren't a lot of performance benefits to using async methods on the server.

But the client is a different story...

== Async on the Client Using Callbacks (JAX-RS 2.0)

Let's say that your service returns a result that is composed of the results of
a few other remote services. You could invoke those remote services serially,
but that really only makes sense if your thread pool is limited. Instead, you
could invoke the services asynchronously, using more threads, but saving time
for the entire call. Here is an example:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/jaxrs20/travel")
public class MyTravelPlanningService {

    private static WebTarget airlineWebTarget = ClientBuilder.newClient()
                                                             .target(App.AIRLINE_URL);

    private static WebTarget hotelWebTarget = ClientBuilder.newClient()
                                                           .target(App.HOTEL_URL);

    private static WebTarget carRentalWebTarget = ClientBuilder.newClient()
                                                               .target(App.RENTAL_URL);

    private class ReservationInvocationCallback implements InvocationCallback<Reservation> {
        private final CountDownLatch latch;
        private final DoubleAdder costAdder;
        Throwable throwable;

        ReservationInvocationCallback(CountDownLatch latch, DoubleAdder adder) {
            this.latch = latch;
            this.costAdder = adder;
        }

        @Override
        public void completed(Reservation r) {
            costAdder.add(r.getCost());
            latch.countDown();
        }

        @Override
        public void failed(Throwable t) {
            t.printStackTrace();
            throwable = t;
            latch.countDown();
        }
    }

    @Path("/cost")
    @GET
    public double getCostOfTravel(@QueryParam("from") String from,
                                  @QueryParam("to") String to,
                                  @QueryParam("startDate") LocalDate start,
                                  @QueryParam("returnDate") LocalDate end) {

        final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);
        final DoubleAdder cost = new DoubleAdder();
        ReservationInvocationCallback callback = new ReservationInvocationCallback(latch, cost);
        airlineWebTarget.queryParam("from", from)
                        .queryParam("to", to)
                        .queryParam("start", start)
                        .queryParam("end", end)
                        .request()
                        .async()
                        .get(callback);
        hotelWebTarget.queryParam("location", to)
                      .queryParam("start", start)
                      .queryParam("end", end)
                      .request()
                      .async()
                      .get(callback);
        carRentalWebTarget.queryParam("location", to)
                          .queryParam("start", start)
                          .queryParam("end", end)
                          .request()
                          .async()
                          .get(callback);

        try {
            latch.await();
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            throw new WebApplicationException(ex, 500);
        }
        if (callback.throwable != null) {
            callback.throwable.printStackTrace();
            throw new WebApplicationException("Failure in downstream service",
                callback.throwable, 500);
        }
        return cost.doubleValue();
    }
}
----

This slightly more complex example uses an `InvocationCallback` which will be
notified when the async response has completed (either through the `completed`
method if the response is successful, or the `failed` method if not). We tell
the client to invoke the services asynchronously by invoking the `async()`
method on the `Invocation.Builder` object that is returned from the `request()`
method. That returns an instance of `AsyncInvoker`.  From there, we use an
instance of the callback to asynchronously invoke three different services.
We'll only end up waiting for as long as the longest of those three services.
Very efficient!

In a failure case we log the exception and then propagate it back to the client.
Also, we are caching and re-using the `WebTarget` for each remote service. This
avoids a lot of object creation in the JAX-RS implementation code, improving
overall performance.

This works well, but JAX-RS 2.1 gives us another option: a reactive client API.

== Async on the Client Using Reactive APIs (JAX-RS 2.1)

JAX-RS 2.1 adds support for reactive APIs. Out of the box, JAX-RS 2.1 supports
a `CompletionStage` return type. This allows users to string together a chain
of stages that can be completed asynchronously. JAX-RS 2.1 also allows users to
extend the reactive capabilities of the client by using other reactive providers
such as RxJava, Guava, etc. For simplicity and brevity, we will only cover the
`CompletionStage` approach here. My colleague, John Koehler is writing a blog
post that will provide more information on reactive extensions. Stay tuned!

Similar to the `async()` method in JAX-RS 2.0 (which is still available in 2.1),
we get an instance of a `CompletionStageRxInvoker` by using the `rx()` method on
the `Invocation.Builder`. The `CompletionStageRxInvoker` has methods similar to
the `AsyncInvoker`, but returns `CompletionStage` rather than `Future`. Also
note that these methods do not take an `InvocationCallback` either.

So, if we were to re-write the JAX-RS 2.0 client example using the reactive
client in JAX-RS 2.1, it would look something like this:

[source,java]

    private static WebTarget hotelWebTarget = ClientBuilder.newClient()
                                                           .target(App.HOTEL_URL);

    private static WebTarget carRentalWebTarget = ClientBuilder.newClient()
                                                               .target(App.RENTAL_URL);


    @Path("/cost")
    @GET
    public double getCostOfTravel(@QueryParam("from") String from,

                                  @QueryParam("startDate") LocalDate start,
                                  @QueryParam("returnDate") LocalDate end) {

        BiConsumer<Reservation, Throwable> consumer = (r, t) -> {
            if (t != null) {
                throwable.set(t);
            } else {
                cost.add(r.getCost());
            }
            latch.countDown();
        };

        airlineWebTarget.queryParam("from", from)
                        .queryParam("to", to)

                        .get(Reservation.class)
                        .whenCompleteAsync(consumer);

        }
        return cost.doubleValue();
    }
}
----

Functionally, the JAX-RS 2.1 reactive client example here is not much different
from the JAX-RS 2.0 async client, but I think the reactive example is cleaner
and easier to understand. And less code to maintain is also nice!

Speaking of less code... hopefully by now you've heard about the MicroProfile
Rest Client. It is a proxy-based, type safe client API for RESTful services.
Starting in MP Rest Client 1.1, you can make asynchronous calls using Java 8's
`CompletionStage`. Let's check out that approach:

== Async on the Client Using Type-Safe Interfaces (MicroProfile Rest Client 1.1)

https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client[MicroProfile Rest Client]
takes a different approach to accessing remote RESTful services - a more
type-safe approach where an interface, annotated similar to a JAX-RS resource,
represents a remote service. Invoking methods on the client interface would be
similar to invoking methods on a service hosted locally - with clever usage of
providers like `ResponseExceptionMapper`, `ParamConverterProvider`,
`MessageBodyReader`, `MessageBodyWriter`, etc. which allows us to design a
service interface that indeed acts like it is local.

In order for a Rest Client method to be executed asynchronously, it must return
a `CompletionStage`. Note that in MP Rest Client 1.2, it is also possible to use
MP Fault Tolerance's `@Asynchronous` annotation. This functionality is outside
the scope of this post, but the jist is that if your interface method returns a
`Future`, then the MP Fault Tolerance implementation will invoke the method on a
separate thread, immediately returning a `Future`. You can find more information
about the Fault Tolerance APIs at the
https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance[project site].

So in our travel planning example, you might want to create client interfaces
like:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/airline")
@RegisterProvider(LocalDateParamConverter.class)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public interface AirlineServiceClient {

    @Path("/cost")
    @GET
    CompletionStage<Reservation> getReservation(@QueryParam("from") String from,
                                                @QueryParam("to") String to,
                                                @QueryParam("start") LocalDate startDate,
                                                @QueryParam("end") LocalDate endDate);
}
----

And you would invoke the client like this:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/mpRest/travel")
public class MyTravelPlanningService {
    private final static String BASE_URI = "http://localhost:" + App.PORT + App.CONTEXT_ROOT;

    private final static AirlineServiceClient AIRLINE_CLIENT = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                                                                                .baseUri(URI.create(BASE_URI))
                                                                                .build(AirlineServiceClient.class);
    private final static HotelServiceClient HOTEL_CLIENT = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                                                                            .baseUri(URI.create(BASE_URI))
                                                                            .build(HotelServiceClient.class);
    private final static CarRentalServiceClient CAR_RENTAL_CLIENT = RestClientBuilder.newBuilder()
                                                                                     .baseUri(URI.create(BASE_URI))
                                                                                     .build(CarRentalServiceClient.class);

    @Path("/cost")
    @GET
    public double getCostOfTravel(@QueryParam("from") String from,
                                  @QueryParam("to") String to,
                                  @QueryParam("startDate") LocalDate start,
                                  @QueryParam("returnDate") LocalDate end) {
        final CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);
        final DoubleAdder cost = new DoubleAdder();
        final AtomicReference<Throwable> throwable = new AtomicReference<>();

        BiConsumer<Reservation, Throwable> consumer = (r, t) -> {
            if (t != null) {
                throwable.set(t);
            } else {
                cost.add(r.getCost());
            }
            latch.countDown();
        };

        AIRLINE_CLIENT.getReservation(from, to, start, end)
                      .whenCompleteAsync(consumer);

        HOTEL_CLIENT.getReservation(to, start, end)
                    .whenCompleteAsync(consumer);

        CAR_RENTAL_CLIENT.getReservation(to, start, end)
                         .whenCompleteAsync(consumer);

        try {
            latch.await();
        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
            throw new WebApplicationException(ex, 500);
        }

        Throwable t = throwable.get();
        if (t != null) {
            throw new WebApplicationException("Failure in downstream service",
                                              t, 500);
        }
        return cost.doubleValue();
    }
}
----

This is even more clean than the JAX-RS 2.1 reactive client API!

The MP Rest Client approach also solves a problem of what to do with
`ThreadLocal` objects that might be required for providers on the outbound
request. Let's say that we have a `ThreadLocal` object in our application that
determines whether a given customer is a preferred loyalty club member. If so,
we might add a `ClientRequestFilter` that would create a custom HTTP header to
indicate that to the remote airline, hotel, or car rental service - something
like `Loyalty-ID: 1234` that might be used by the remote service to upgrade the
reservation. The problem is that if the `ClientRequestFilter` checks the
`ThreadLocal` object for the loyalty ID number on the asynchronous thread, it
won't be there - it was associated with the calling thread, not the async
thread. This picture might help clarify the problem.

image::/img/blog/asyncREST-thread-local-problem.png[]

Notice that the Loyalty ID is set on the calling thread, but that ID isn't
propagated to the async threads that are making the requests to the remote
services.  That's where the `AsyncInvocationInterceptor` come into play. This is
a provider type introduced in MP Rest Client 1.1 that allows users to propagate
`ThreadLocal` objects - or really anything that is associated with the calling
thread. This interface contains two methods (a third method is added in MP Rest
Client 1.2 for removing contexts): `prepareContext()` and `applyContext()`. The
former is invoked on the calling thread prior to "swapping" threads. The latter
is invoked on the async thread.

image::/img/blog/asyncREST-thread-local-solution.png[]

The `AsyncInvocationInterceptor` must be created by a
`AsyncInvocationInterceptorFactory` like so:

[source,java]
----
public class LoyaltyAsyncInvocationInterceptorFactory
    implements AsyncInvocationInterceptorFactory {

    @Override
    public AsyncInvocationInterceptor newInterceptor() {
        return new AsyncInvocationInterceptor() {

            String loyaltyId;

            @Override
            public void prepareContext() {
                loyaltyId = App.LOYALTY_ID_THREADLOCAL.get();
            }

            @Override
            public void applyContext() {
                App.LOYALTY_ID_THREADLOCAL.set(loyaltyId);
            }};
    }
}
----

Let's assume that loyalty members get a 10% discount when booking hotels online.
Now let's try invoking our travel planning site with a loyalty ID:

image::/img/blog/asyncREST-curl-output.png[]

With MP Rest Client we can get our loyalty discount and save about $200!

== Summary

It's getting easier to do things asynchronously with REST and Java. JAX-RS and
MicroProfile give you some powerful tools in this space. Hopefully now you are
more prepared to write and consumer RESTful services asynchronously.

If you've got any questions or run into any problems, please let us know. You

Thanks!
